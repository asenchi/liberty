<h1>Apostle's Creed</h1>
<p>
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and earth.<br />
I also believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son our Lord:<br />
Conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary<br />
suffered under Pontius Pilate, crucified, dead and buried.<br />
</p>
<p>
He descended into Hell; Rose again the third day;<br />
Ascended into Heaven; Sat down at the right hand of the Father.<br />
Thence He will come to judge the living and the dead.<br />
</p>
<p>
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church<br />
the communion of saints, the remission of sins<br />
the resurrection of flesh and life eternal.<br />
</p>
<p>
Amen.
