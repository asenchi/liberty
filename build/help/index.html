title: &#34;First Line of Song&#34;
structure: [[v1, c1],[v2, c1, b1]]
inkey: key     # (i.e: a)
speed: speed   # (i.e. one of fast or slow)
v1: |
 Text defined in these blocks represent the song lyrics.
 This represents verse 1.
 The &#39;v1&#39; label defines this portion of the song.
 The &#39;|&#39; character is very important and should always be included after the label.
 These labels allow us to define a structure for the song.
 Add 1 space before each line of the song.
 This structure is defined at the top of the file.
 The outer square brackets represent the entire song.
 The inner brackets define slides.
 &#39;v1&#39; and &#39;c1&#39; are defined as slide one.
v2: |
 This is verse 2.
 Find &#39;v2&#39; in the structure above.
 Notice that it is listed in a separate set of brackets from &#39;v1&#39;.
 &#39;v2&#39; and &#39;c1&#39; are slide two.
 Since we sing the chorus after each verse, we include the chorus on each slide.
c1: |
 This is the chorus.
 As noted above, we include it on both slides.
 If there are more chorus&#39;, increment the number, so the next chorus would be &#39;c2&#39;.
 Each section of the song should be uniquely labeled (&#39;v1&#39;, &#39;v2&#39;,etc.)
 The labels are arbitrary, you could use &#39;v1&#39;, &#39;v2&#39; for example.
 The &#39;:&#39; and &#39;|&#39; are very important for how the song is displayed.
b1: |
 This is an example for defining a bridge and is only shown on the 2nd slide.
 It is a good idea to look at the structure of existing songs for more examples.
 Look at this document closely, this would display properly as an actual song. :)
