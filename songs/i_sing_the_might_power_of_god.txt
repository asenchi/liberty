structure: [[v1],[v2],[v3]]
inkey: z
speed: slow
v1: |
 I sing the mighty power of God
 That made the mountains rise
 That spread the flowing seas abroad
 And built the lofty skies
 I sing the wisdom that ordained
 The sun to rule the day
 The moon shines full at His command
 And all the stars obey
v2: |
 I sing the goodness of the Lord
 That filled the earth with food
 He formed the creatures with His word
 And then pronounced them good
 Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed
 Where'er I turn my eye
 If I survey the ground I tread
 Or graze up on the sky
v3: |
 There's not a plant or flower below
 But makes Thy glories known
 And clouds arise and tempests blow
 By order from Thy throne
 While all that borrows life from Thee
 Is ever in Thy care
 And everywhere that man can be
 Thou, God art present there
