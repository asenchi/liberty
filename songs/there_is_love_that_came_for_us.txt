 There is Love that came for us
 Humbled to a sinner's cross
 You broke my shame and sinfulness
 You rose again victorious

 Faithfulness none can deny
 Through the storm and through the fire
 There is truth that sets me free
 Jesus Christ who lives in me

 You are stronger, You are stronger
 Sin is broken, You have saved me
 It is written, Christ is risen
 Jesus You are Lord of all

 No beginning and no end
 You're my hope my defense
 You came to seek and save the lost
 You paid it all upon the cross

 So let Your name be lifted higher
 Be lifted higher
 Be lifted higher
