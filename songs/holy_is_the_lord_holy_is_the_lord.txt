 Holy is the Lord, holy is the Lord
 As we bow before Your throne
 Majesty and honor to You alone
 Majesty and honor to You alone
v2: |
 Worthy are You Lord, worthy are You Lord
 Sweet Lamb of God the chosen One
 Our lives we gladly lay before Your throne
 Our lives we gladly lay before Your throne
pc1: |
 No longer will we give our hearts
 To the things of this world
 For a debt of love we will offer to You
 We look for the day when every knee will bow
 And we will join with the angels around Your throne
 And we will sing
c1: |
 Holy is the Lord
