 This is a Holy moment

 He is here with us now

 Come with expectation
 Everything abandoned
 Look and see the Glory of our God
 Lift your voice to Heaven
 Jesus is our anthem
 Celebrate the wonder of His love

 For Your honor and fame
 Fall again in this place
 Fill us up as we overflow with praise
