v1: |
 Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
 Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings
 Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
 Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings
c1: |
 This is amazing grace, this is unfailing love
 That You would take my place, that You would bear my cross
 You laid down Your life, that I would be set free
 Oh, Jesus, I sing for, all that You've done for me
v2: |
 Who brings our chaos back into order
 Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings
 Who rules the nations with truth and justice
 Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings
b1: |
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
 Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
b2: |
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, worthy, worthy, worthy
