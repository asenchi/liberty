v1: |
 Alone in my sorrow and dead in my skin
 Lost without hope with no place to begin
 Your love made a way to let mercy come in
 When death was arrested and my life began
v2: |
 Ash was redeemed only beauty remains
 My orphan heart was given a name
 My mourning grew quiet my feet rose to dance
 When death was arrested and my life began
c1: |
 Oh Your grace so free, washes over me
 You have made me new, now life begins with You
 It's Your endless love, pouring down on us
 You have made us new, now life begins with You
v3: |
 Released from my chains I'm a prisoner no more
 My shame was a ransom He faithfully bore
 He cancelled my debt and He called me his friend
 When death was arrested and my life began
c2: |
 Our Savior displayed on a criminal's cross
 Darkness rejoiced as though heaven had lost
 But then Jesus arose with our freedom in hand
 That's when death was arrested and my life began
