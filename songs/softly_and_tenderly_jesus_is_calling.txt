v1: |
 Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
 Calling for you and for me
 See, on the portals He's waiting and watching
 Watching for you and for me
v2: |
 Come home, come home, ye who are weary, come home
 Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
 Calling, "O sinner, come home!"
v3: |
 Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading
 Pleading for you and for me
 Why should we linger and heed not His mercies
 Mercies for you and for me
