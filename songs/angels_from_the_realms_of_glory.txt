v1: |
￼Angels from the realms of glory
 Wing your flight o’er all the earth
 Ye who sang creation’s story Now proclaim Messiah’s birth
c1: |
 Come and worship, come and worship
 Worship Christ, the new born King
v2: |
 Shepherds in the field abiding
 Watching o’er Your flocks by night
 God with us is now residing
 Yonder shines the Infant light
c3: |
 Saints before the alter bending
 Watching long in hope and fear
 Suddenly the Lord descending
 In His temple shall appear
