v1: |
 Jesus, lover of my soul
 All consuming fire is in Your gaze
 Jesus, I want You to know
 I will follow You all my days
pc1: |
 For no one else in history is like You
 And history itself belongs to You
 Alpha and Omega, You have loved me
 And I will share eternity with You
c1: |
 It's all about You, Jesus
 And all this is for You
 For Your glory and Your fame
 It's not about me
 As if You should do things my way
 You alone are God, and I surrender to Your ways
