verse1: |
 Nothing can separate
 Even if I turn away
 Your love never fails
 Though I may make mistakes
 Your mercies are new everyday
 Your love never fails
chorus: |
 You stay the same through the ages
 Your love never changes
 There may be pain in the night but joy comes in the morning
 And when the oceans rage
 I don't have to be afraid
 Because I know that You love me
 And Your love never fails
verse2: |
 Your truth has come and set us free
 And Your Spirit now lives in me
 Your love never fails
 The chasm was far too wide
 But You reached across to the other side
 Your love never fails
bridge: |
 You make all things work together for Your good
