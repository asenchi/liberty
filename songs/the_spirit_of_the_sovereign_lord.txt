 The spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon us
 Because He has anointed us to preach good news
v1: |
 He has sent us to the poor, this is the year
 To bind up the broken hearted, this is the day
 To bring freedom to the captives, this is the year
 And to release the ones in darkness
c1: |
 This is the year of the favor of the Lord
 This is the day of vengeance of our God
 This is the year of the favor of the Lord
 This is the day of vengeance of our God
v2: |
 He will comfort all who mourn, this is the year
 He will provide for those who grieve, this is the day
 He will pour out of the oil of gladness, this is the year
 Instead of mourning you will praise
