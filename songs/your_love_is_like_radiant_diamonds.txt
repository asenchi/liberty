 Your love is like radiant diamonds
 Bursting inside us we cannot contain
 Your love will surely come to find us
 Like blazing wild fire singing Your name

 God of mercy sweet love divine
 I have surrendered to Your design
 May this offering stretch across the skies
 And these Hallelujahs be multiplied

 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, to You Lord
