 As the deer panteth for the water
 So my soul longeth after You
 You alone are my heart’s desire
 And I long to worship You

 You're my friend and You are my brother
 Even though You are a King
 I love You more than any other
 So much more than anything

 I want You more than gold and silver
 Only You can satisfy
 You along are the real joy giver
 And the apple of my eye
c1: |
 You alone are my strength, my shield
 To You alone will my spirit yield
 You alone are my heart’s desire
 And I long to worship You
