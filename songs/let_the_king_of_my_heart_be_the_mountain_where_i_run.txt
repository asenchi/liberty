 Let the King of my heart be the mountain where I run
 The fountain I drink from; oh He is my song
 Let the King of my heart be the shadow where I hide
 The ransom for my life; oh, He is my song

 Let the King of my heart be the wind in my sails
 The anchor in the waves; oh He is my song
 Let the King of my heart be the fire inside my veins
 And the echo of my days; oh He is my song

 You are good, good, oh
b1: |
 You're never gonna let, never gonna let me down
 You're never gonna let, never gonna let me down
