v1: |
 My Lord, what love is this that pays so dearly
 That I, the guilty one, may go free
c1: |
 Amazing love, O what sacrifice, the Son of God, giv'n for me
 My debt He pays, and my death He dies that I might live
v3: |
 And so they watched Him die despised, rejected
 But oh, the blood He shed flowed for me
v4: |
 And now this love of Christ shall flow like rivers
 Come wash your guilt away, live again
