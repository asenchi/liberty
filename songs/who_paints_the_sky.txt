 Who paints the sky into glorious day
 Only the splendor of Jesus
 Who breathes His life into fists of clay
 Only the splendor of Jesus
 Who shapes the valleys and brings the rain
 Only the splendor of Jesus
 Who makes the desert to live again
 Only the splendor of Jesus
c1: |
 O-O-O
 Teach every nation His marvelous ways
 O-O-O
 Each generation shall sing His praise
c2: |
 He is wonderful, He is glorious
 Clothed in righteousness, full of tenderness
 Come and worship Him, He's the Prince of life
 He will cleanse our hearts in His river of fire
v2: |
 Who hears the cry of the barren one
 Only the mercy of Jesus
 Who breaks the curse of the heart of stone
 Only the mercy of Jesus
 Who storms the prison and sets men free
 Only the mercy of Jesus
 Purchasing souls for eternity
 Only the mercy of Jesus
