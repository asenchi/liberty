 We stand and lift up our hands
 For the joy of the Lord is our strength
 We bow down and worship Him now
 How great how awesome is He
 And together we sing
chorus: |
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty
 The earth is filled with His glory
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty
 The earth is filled with His glory
 The earth is filled with His glory

 It's rising up all around
 It's the anthem of the Lord's renown
 It's the anthem of the Lord's renown
 And together we sing
 Everyone sing
