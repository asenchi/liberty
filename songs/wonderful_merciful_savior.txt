 Wonderful merciful Savior
 Precious Redeemer and Friend
 Who could have thought that a Lamb could
 Rescue the souls of men, oh You rescue the souls of men

 Counselor, Comforter, Keeper
 Spirit we long to embrace
 You offer hope when our hearts have
 Hopelessy lost the way, oh we hopelessly lost the way

 You are the One that we adore
 You give the healing and grace our
 Hearts always hunger for, oh our hearts always hunger for

 Faithfully loving Your own
 Here in our weakness You find us
 Falling before Your throne, oh we're falling before Your throne
