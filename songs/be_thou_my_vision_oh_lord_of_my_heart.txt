 Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
 Naught be all else to me save that Thou art
 Thou my best thought by day or by night
 Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light
verse2: |
 Be Thou my my wisdom and Thou my true word
 I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord
 Thou my great Father, I thy true son
 Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

 Riches I heed not nor man's empty praise
 Thou mine inheritence now and always
 Thou and Thou only first in my heart
 High King of Heaven my treasure Thou art
verse4: |
 Be Thou my breastplate, my sword for the fight
 Be Thou my armor and be Thou my might
 Thou my soul shelter and Thy my high tower
 Raise Thou me heavenward O Power of my power
verse5: |
 High King of heaven my victory won
 May I reach heaven's joy, O bright heaven't sun
 Heart of my own heart whatever befall
 Still be my vision O Ruler of all
