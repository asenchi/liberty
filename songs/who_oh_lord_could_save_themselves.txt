v1: |
 Who, oh Lord, could save themselves
 Their own soul could heal
 Our shame was deeper than the sea
 Your grace is deeper still
c1: |
 You alone can rescue, You alone can save
 You alone can lift us from the grave
 You came down to find us, led us out of death
 To You alone belongs the highest praise
v2: |
 You, oh Lord, have made a way
 The great divide You heal
 For when our hearts were far away
 Your love went further still
 Yes, Your love goes further still
b1: |
 We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes
 You're the Giver of Life
