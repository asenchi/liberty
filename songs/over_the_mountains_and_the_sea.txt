v1: |
 Over the mountains and the sea
 Your river runs with love for me
 And I will open up my heart and let the Healer set me free
 I'm happy to be in the truth
 And I will lift my daily hands
 For I will always sing of when Your love came down
c1: |
 I could sing of Your love forever
 I could sing of Your love forever
 I could sing of Your love forever
 I could sing of Your love forever
b1: |
 Oh I feel like dancing
 It's foolishness I know
 But when the world has seen the light
 They will dance with joy
 Like we're dancing now
