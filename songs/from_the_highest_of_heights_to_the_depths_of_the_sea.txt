v1: |
 From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
 Creationâ€™s revealing Your majesty
 From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring
 Every creature unique in the song that it sings, all exclaiming
c1: |
 Indescribable, uncontainable,
 You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name
 You are amazing God
c2: |
 All powerful, untamable
 Awestruck we lift up our voice and we humbly proclaim
 You are amazing God
v2: |
 Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
 Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
 Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
 Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
 None can fathom
c3: |
 Incomparable, unchangeable
 You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
 You are amazing God
