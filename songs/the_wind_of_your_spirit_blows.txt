v1: |
 The wind of Your Spirit blows
 Through the dry places Your river flows
 My soul finds rest in You alone
v2: |
 I'll make my boast in the Lord
 My broken spirit
 He has restored
 I will rejoice in God alone
c1: |
 I will sing, I will dance
 I will glorify my King
 Lord Your love has captured me
 I will praise, I will shout
 I will run to seek Your face
 Your awesome presence covers me
