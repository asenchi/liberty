v1: |
 If my heart is overwhelmed and I cannot hear Your voice
 I hold onto what is true, though I cannot see
 If the storms of life they come, and the road ahead gets steep
 I will lift these hands in faith, I will believe
pc1: |
 I remind myself of all that You've done
 And the life I have because of Your Son
c1: |
 Love came down and rescued me
 Love came down and set me free
 I am Yours, I am forever Yours
 Mountain high or valley low
 I sing out and remind my soul
 I am Yours, I am forever Yours
v2: |
 When my heart is fill with hope
 And every promise comes my way
 When I feel Your hands of grace, rest upon me
 Staying desperate for You God, staying humbled at Your feet
 I will lift these hands and praise, I will believe
b1: |
 I am Yours, I am Yours, all my days Jesus I am Yours
b2: |
 I'm Yours I'm Yours forever
 I'm Yours I'm Yours forever
 I'm Yours I"m Yours forevermore
