v1: |
 Though the Earth cried out for blood
 Satisfied her hunger was
 Her billows calmed on raging seas
 For the souls of men she craved
 Sun and moon from balcony 
 Turned their head in disbelief
 Their precious love would taste the sting
 Disfigured and disdained
v2: |
 So three days in darkness slept
 The Morning Sun of righteousness
 But rose to shame the throes of death
 And overturn his rule
 Now daughters and the sons of men
 Would pay not their dues again
 The debt of blood they owed was rent
 When the day rolled anew
c1: |
 On Friday a thief, on Sunday a King
 Laid down in grief, but awoke with keys
 Of Hell on that day, the first born of the slain
 The Man Jesus Christ laid death in his grave
b1: |
 He has cheated Hell and seated us above the fall
 In desperate places He paid our wages, one time once and for all
