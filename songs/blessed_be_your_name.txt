 Blessed be Your name in the land that is plentiful
 Where Your streams of abundance flow
 Blessed be Your name

 Though I walk through the wilderness
 Blessed be your name

 Every blessing You pour out I'll turn back to praise
 And when the darkness closes in Lord
 Still I will say

 Blessed be Your name
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
 Blessed be Your glorious name

 When the world's all as it should be
 Blessed be Your name
 And blessed be Your name on the road marked with suffering
 Though there's pain in the offering
 Blessed be Your name

 You give and take away
 You give and take away
 My heart will choose to say
 Lord, blessed be Your name
