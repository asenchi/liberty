v1: |
 Amazing Grace How sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost, but now I’m found
 Was blind, but now I see
v2: |
 ‘Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear
 And Grace my fears relieved
 How precious did that Grace appear
 The hour I first believed
c1: |
 My chains are gone, I’ve been set free
 My God, my Savior has ransomed me
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns
 Unending love, Amazing Grace
v3: |
 The Lord has promised good to me
 His Word my hope secures
 He will my shield and portion be
 As long as life endures
v4: |
 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
 The sun forbear to shine
 But God who called me here below
 Will be forever mine
