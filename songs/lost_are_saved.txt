 Lost are saved, find their way
 At the sound of Your great name
 All condemned, feel no shame
 At the sound of Your great name
 Every fear, has no place
 At the sound of Your great name
 The enemy, he has to leave
 At the sound of Your great name

 Jesus, worthy is the Lamb
 That was slain for us Son of God and Man
 You are high and lifted up
 And all the world will praise Your great name
v2: |
 All the weak, find their strength
 At the sound of Your great name
 Hungry souls, receive grace
 At the sound of Your great name
 The fatherless, they find their rest
 At the sound of Your great name
 Sick are healed, and the dead are raised
 At the sound of Your great name

 Redeemer, my Healer, Lord Almighty
 My Savior, Defender, You are my King
