v1: |
 O Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder
 Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
 I see the stars I hear the rolling thunder
 Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed
c1: |
 Then sings my soul my savior God to Thee
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art
v2: |
 When through the woods and forest glades I wander
 And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
 When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
 And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze
v3: |
 And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
 Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
 That on the cross my burdens gladly bearing
 He bled and died to take away my sin
v4: |
 When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
 And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
 Then I shall bow in humble adoration
 And there proclaim, My God, how great Thou art
