  Love fell down to the bloodstained ground
  Now Your grace abounds forever
  You are love and You gave me life
  Now we'll walk this road together

  I will sing of Your love in the morning
  I will sing of Your faithfulness at night
  I will sing of Your mercy, Lord, all my life
  All my life I will sing
