 Sing a song of victory, shout aloud unto the Lord
 Who is like the living God, Yahweh is for us
 Tell of all His faithfulness; our lives have been restored
 Hallelujah we are blessed
 Yahweh is for us
c1: |
 He hears, He hears every faithful prayer
 He sees, He's watching with tender care
 He knows, He knows every pain we bear
 From the highest heaven His mercies flow
 To the ends of the earth His people know
 Yahweh is for us

 Yahweh is for us
v3: |
 All the idols of this age come from a world of lies
 Nothing in their wooden hearts but Yahweh is for us
 They cannot see our needs; they cannot hear our cries
 Only Yahweh intervenes
 Yahweh is for us
