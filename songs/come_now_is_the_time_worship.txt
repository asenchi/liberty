v1: |
 Come, now is the time to worship
 Come, now is the time to give your heart
 Come, just as you are to worship
 Come, just as you are before your God, come
c1: |
 One day every tongue will confess You are God
 One day every knee will bow
 Still the greatest treasure remains for those
 Who gladly choose You now
