 King of Kings, Majesty
 God of heaven living in me
 Gentle Saviour, closest friend
 Strong Deliv'rer, Beginning and End
 All within me falls at Your throne
c1: |
 Your Majesty, I can but bow
 I lay my all before You now
 In royal robes I don't deserve
 I live to serve Your Majesty
v2: |
 Earth and heav'n worship You
 Love eternal, faithful and true
 Who bought the nations, ransomed souls
 Brought this sinner near to Your throne
 All within me cries out in praise
