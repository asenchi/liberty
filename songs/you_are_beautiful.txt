 You are beautiful
 The treasure of my heart
 You are wonderful
 My heart's desire
v1: |
 I'm so in love with You Jesus
 So in love with You Jesus
 Overwhelmed by Your mercy
 Amazed by Your grace

 You are my hope in despair
 You are my beauty for ashes
 My dancing in the morning
 You are my light in the darkness
 My strength in the weakness, peace in confusion
 My anchor through the storm
 My victory cry in the battle
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
