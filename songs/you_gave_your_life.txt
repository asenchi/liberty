 You gave Your life, as a sacrifice
 So I surrender all
 You left Your throne, and made me Your own
 Now I surrender all
v2: |
 Salvation came, through Your mighty Name
 The power of sin and death no longer reigns
 Your victory is now complete
 New life, and love and hope for all mankind
c1: |
 Bless the Lord, oh my soul
 And all that is within me
 Bless the Lord, oh my soul
 Glory to Your name

 When I behold Your matchless love
 Lord I surrender all
 Upon that tree, Lord You set me free
 Now I surrender all
v4: |
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch, saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost, but now I'm found
 I once was blind, but now I can see
b1: |
 Now I will live forever in Your presence Lord
 And worship You in spirit and in truth
 With all the saints before the Throne of glory
 We will bow down before Your majesty
