v1: |
  Before the throne of God above
  I have a strong a perfect plea
  A great high priest whose name is Love
  Who ever lives and pleads for me
  My name is graven on His hands
  My name is written on His heart
  I know that while in heav'n He stands
  No tongue can bid me thence depart
  No tongue can bid me thence depart
v2: |
  When Satan tempts me to despair
  And tells me of the guilt within
  Upward I look and see Him there
  Who made an end to all my sin
  Because the sinless Savior died
  My sinful soul is counted free
  For God the just is satisfied
  To look on Him and pardon me
  To look on Him and pardon me
v3: |
  Behold Him there the risen Lamb
  My perfect spotless righteousness
  The great unchangable I Am
  The King of glory and of grace
  One with Himself I cannot die
  My soul is purchased with His blood
  My life is hid with Christ on high
  With Christ my Savior and my God
  With Christ my Savior and my God
