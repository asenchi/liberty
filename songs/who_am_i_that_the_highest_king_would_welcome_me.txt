v1: |
  Who am I that the highest King
  Would welcome me?
  I was lost but He brought me in
  Oh His love for me, oh His love for me
v2: |
  Free at last, He has ransomed me
  His grace runs deep
  While I was a slave to sin
  Jesus died for me, yes He died for me
c1: |
  Who the Son sets free, oh is free indeed
  I’m a child of God, yes I am
c2: |
  Who the Son sets free, oh is free indeed
  I’m a child of God, Yes I am
  In my Father’s house, There’s a place for me
  I’m a child of God, Yes I am
b1: |
  I am chosen, not forsaken
  I am who You say I am
  You are for me, not against me
  I am who You say I am
