 There is no other God like You
 You alone, You alone
 There is no other name I will sing
 You alone, You alone
 There is no other name I will praise
 You alone, You alone
 There is no other to whom I will bow
 You alone, You alone
c1: |
 You alone I long to worship
 You alone I long to praise
 To you alone I bow my knee
 As I come to Your throne of grace
 As I come to Your throne of grace
