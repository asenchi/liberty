 You're the reason I live
 You're my quest, my constant vision
 You're the water I drink, the treasure I seek
 More than gold

 You're the fire in my heart
 My consuming love and passion
 You're the air that I breathe
 The song that I sing
 From my heart and soul

 Jesus, Lord over all
 You're the Lord over me
 Jesus, drawn to this altar I come
 Here is my heart
 May Your will be done in me
