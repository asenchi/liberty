v1: |
 Amazing Grace How sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost, but now I’m found
 Was blind, but now I see
v2: |
 ‘Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear
 And Grace my fears relieved
 How precious did that Grace appear the hour I first believed
v3: |
 Through many dangers, toils and snares
 I have already come
 'Tis Grace hath brought me safe thus far
 And Grace will lead me home
v4: |
 The Lord has promised good to me
 His Word my hope secures
 He will my shield and portion be
 As long as life endures
v5: |
 When We’ve been there ten thousand years
 Bright shining as the sun
 We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
 Than when we first begun.
