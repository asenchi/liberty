v1: |
 Down the mountain the river flows
 And it brings refreshing wherever it goes
 Thru the valleys and over the fields
 The river is rushing and the river is here
c1: |
 The river of God sets our feet-a-dancing
 The river of God fills our hearts with cheer
 The river of God fills our mouth with laughter
 And we rejoice for the river is here
v2: |
 The river of God is teeming with life
 All who touch it can be revived
 And those who linger on this river's shore
 Will come back thirsting for more of the Lord
v3: |
 Up to the mountain we love to go
 To find the presence of the Lord
 Along the banks of the river we run
 We dance with laughter giving praise to the Son
