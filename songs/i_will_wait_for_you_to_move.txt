 I will wait for You to move
 For Your mighty hand to save
 When the troubled waters rise
 You are my hiding place
 You are my hiding place

 Your walls are salvation, Your gates are praise
 Your walls are salvation, Your gates are praise

 My Deliverer
 Is the Lord

 Who is like You mighty God
 Who can take me from Your hand
 As I walk with You in freedom
 You're the Rock on which I stand
 You're the Rock on which I stand
