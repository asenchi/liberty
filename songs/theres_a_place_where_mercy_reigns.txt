v1: |
 There's a place where mercy reigns, and never dies
 There's a place where streams of grace, flow deep and wide
 Where all the love I've ever found
 Comes like a flood, comes flowing down
c1: |
 At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life
 I'm in awe of You, I'm in awe of You
 Where Your love ran red, and my sin washed white
 I owe all to You, I owe all to You, Jesus
v2: |
 There's a place where sin and shame, are powerless
 Where my heart has peace with God, and forgiveness
 Where all the love I've ever found
 Comes like a flood, comes flowing down
b1: |
 Here my hope is found, here on holy ground
 Here I bow down, here I bow down
 Here arms open wide, here You saved my life
 Here I bow down, here I bow
