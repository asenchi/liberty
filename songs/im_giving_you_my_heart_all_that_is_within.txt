v1: |
 I'm giving You my heart, all that is within
 I lay it all down, for the sake of You my King
 I'm giving You my dreams, laying down my rights
 I'm giving up my pride, for the promise of new life
c1: |
 And I surrender
 All to You, all to You
v2: |
 I'm singing You this song, I'm waiting at the Cross
 All the world holds dear, I count it all as loss
 For the sake of knowing You, for the glory of Your name
 To know the lasting joy, even sharing in Your pain
