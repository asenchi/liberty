 You are my strength when I am weak
 You are the treasure that I seek
 You are my all and all
 Seeking You as a precious Jewel
 Lord to give up I'd be a fool
 You are my all in all

 Taking my sin my cross my shame
 Rising again I bless Your name
 You are my all in all
 When I fall Down You pick me up
 When I am dry You fill my cup
 You are my all in all

 Jesus Lamb of God worthy is Your Name
 Jesus Lamb of God worthy is Your Name
