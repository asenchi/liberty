 A thousand times I've failed, still Your mercy remains
 And should I stumble again, I'm caught in Your grace
 Everlasting, Your light will shine when all else fades
 Never ending Your glory goes beyond all fame
v2: |
 My heart and my soul, I give You control
 Consume me from the inside out Lord
 Let justice and praise become my embrace
 To love You from the inside out
v3: |
 Your will above all else, still my purpose remains
 The art of losing myself in bringing You praise
 Everlasting Your light will shine when all else fades
 Never ending Your glory goes beyond all things
c1: |
 Everlasting Your light will shine when all else fades
 Never ending Your glory goes beyond all things
 And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise
 From the inside out Lord my soul cries out
