v1: |
 Over all the earth You reign on high
 Every mountain stream, every sunset sky
 But my one request, Lord my only aim
 Is that You reign in me
c1: |
 Lord reign in me, Reign in Your power
 Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour
 You are the Lord of all I am
 So won’t You reign in me
v2: |
 Over every thought, over every word
 May my life reflect the beauty of the Lord
 You mean more to me than any earthly thing
 So won’t You reign in me
