v1: |
 Rock of ages, cleft for me
 Let me hide myself in Thee
 Let the water and the blood
 From Your wounded side which flowed
 Be of sin the double cure
 Save from warth and make me pure
v2: |
 Could my tears forever flow
 Could my zeal no languor know
 These for sin could not atone
 You must save, and You alone
 In my hand no price I bring
 Simply to Your cross I cling
v3: |
 While I draw this fleeting breath
 When my eyes shall close in death
 When I rise to worlds unknown
 And behold You on Your throne
 Rock of ages, cleft for me
 Let me hide myself in Thee
