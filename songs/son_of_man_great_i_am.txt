 Son of Man, Great I Am, King of heaven
 Son of God, You hold the measure of my days
 Holy Lamb, spotless Lamb, You are worthy, I am not
 Before Your throne I stand amazed
v2: |
 Every tongue confess and every knee will bow
 To Jesus Christ the Lord forever, hear our praises now
c1: |
 Your name is matchless, Your name is priceless
 Your name means more than I could know
 You're so far above me, the way that You love me
 Goes further than any love could go
v3: |
 Wonderful Counselor, Root of David, Morning Star
 You are the way, the truth, the life
 Lion of the tribe of Judah, Mighty God is who You are
 The only perfect sacrifice
b1: |
 In Your name You took the blind man
 And You gave him back his sight
 In Your name You took the dead man
 And You brought him back to life
 In Your name You took this prisoner
 And You opened up the doors
 And I will sing before Your throne forever more
