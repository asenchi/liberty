 Holy uncreated One, Your beauty fills the skies
 But the glory of Your majesty is the mercy in Your eyes

 Worthy uncreated One, from heaven to earth come down
 You laid aside Your royalty to wear the sinner's crown

 O great God, be glorified
 Our lives laid down, Yours magnified
 O great God, be lifted high
 There is none like You

 Jesus, Saviour, God's own Son, risen, reigning Lord
 Sustainer of the universe, by the power of Your Word

 And when we see Your matchless face
 In speechless awe we'll stand
 And there we'll bow with grateful hearts unto the great I Am
