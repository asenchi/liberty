v1: |
 The moon and stars they wept
 The morning sun was dead
 The Savior of the world was fallen
 His body on the cross
 His blood poured out for us
 The weight of every curse upon Him
v2: |
 One final breath He gave
 As heaven looked away
 The Son of God was laid, in darkness
 A battle in the grave
 The war on death was waged
 The power of hell forever broken
pc1: |
 The ground began to shake, the stone was rolled away
 His perfect love could not be overcome
 Now death where is your sting, our resurrected King
 Has rendered you defeated
c1: |
 Forever He is glorified, forever He is lifted high
 Forever He is risen, He is alive, He is alive
b1: |
 We sing hallelujah, we sing hallelujah
 We sing hallelujah, the Lamb has overcome
