 I lift my eyes up to the mountains
 Where does my help come from
 My help comes from You
 Maker of Heaven, Creator of the earth

 O how I need You Lord, You are my only hope
 You are my only prayer
 So I will wait for You and put my trust in You
 For You are always there

 Let us abide in You
 You are the fountain of life and blessing
 All good things come from You
