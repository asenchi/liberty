 May our homes be filled with dancing
 May our streets be filled with joy
 May injustice bow to Jesus
 As the people turn and pray

 From the mountain to the valley
 Hear our praises rise to You
 From the heavens to the nations
 Hear the singing fill the air
v2: |
 May a light shine in the darkness
 As we walk before the cross
 May Your glory fill the whole earth
 As the water o'er the seas
b1: |
 Hallelujah, hallelujah
 Hallelujah, hallelujah
