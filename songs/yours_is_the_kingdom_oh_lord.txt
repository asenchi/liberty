 Yours is the kingdom, oh Lord
 And the power and the glory forever
 With Your rule extending over all the earth

 Our Father, who reigns in heaven
 Hallowed be Your name
 May Your kingdom come
 And Your will be done

 Give us this day our daily bread
 Forgive us as we forgive
 And lead us not into temptation
 But deliver us from all evil
