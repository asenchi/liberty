speed: z
v1: |
 No eye has seen and no ear has heard
 And no mind has ever conceived
 The glorious things that You have prepared
 For everyone who has believed
 You brought us near and You called us Your own
 And made us joint heirs with Your Son
c1: |
 How high and how wide, how deep and how long
 How sweet and how strong is Your love
 How lavish Your grace, how faithful Your ways
 How great is Your love, O Lord
v2: |
 Objects of mercy, who should have known wrath
 Were filled with unspeakable joy
 Riches of wisdom, unsearchable wealth
 And the wonder of knowing Your voice
 You are our treasure and our great reward
 Our hope and our glorious King
