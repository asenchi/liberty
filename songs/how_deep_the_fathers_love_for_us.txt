v1: |
 How deep the Father’s love for us
 How vast beyond all measure
 That He should give His only Son
 To make a wretch His treasure
 How great the pain of searing loss
 The Father turns His face away
 As wounds which mar the Chosen One
 Bring many sons to glory
v2: |
 Behold the Man upon a cross
 My sin upon His shoulders
 Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
 Call out among the scoffers
 It was my sin that held Him there
 Until it was accomplished
 His dying breath has bro’t me life
 I know that it is finished
v3: |
 I will not boast in anything
 No gifts, no pow’r, no wisdom
 But I will boast in Jesus Christ
 His death and resurrection
 Why should I gain from His reward
 I cannot give an answer
 But this I know with all my heart
 His wounds have paid my ransom
v4: |
 Why should I gain from His reward
 I cannot give an answer
 But this I know with all my heart
 His wounds have paid my ransom
