v1: |
 Streams of worship and rivers of praise
 Ascending to the one who is the Ancient of Days
 To Him who is worthy, to Him who was slain
 To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb
c1: |
 You are worthy, You are holy
 The Lord who was, the Lord who is
 The Lord who is to come
 You are awesome, You are mighty
 Be praise and honor and glory forevermore
v2: |
 Thousands upon thousands encircle the throne
 Singing a new song to the one who is to come
 To Him who is worthy, to Him who was slain
 To Him who sits upon the throne and to the lamb
