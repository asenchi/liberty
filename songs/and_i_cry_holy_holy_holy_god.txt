￼And I cry Holy, Holy, Holy God
 How awesome is Your name
 Holy, Holy, Holy God
 How majestic is Your reign
 And I am changed in the presence of a Holy God

 In the presence of a Holy God 
 There’s new meaning now to grace 
 You took all my sins upon Yourself 
 I can only stand amazed

 In the presence of Your infinite might
 I’m so small and frail and weak
 When I see Your power and wisdom, Lord
 I have no words left to speak in the presence of Your glory

 All my crowns lie in the dust
 You are righteous in Your Judgments, Lord
 You are faithful, true, and just
