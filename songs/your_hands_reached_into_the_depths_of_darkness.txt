v1: |
 Your hands reached into the depths of darkness
 Your arms pulled me to the light above
 Your voice spoke the word that broke my heart
 Your eyes burn with holy passion, fire, and love
v2: |
 You lead me beside the quiet waters
 You walk in the shadows of death's darkened door
 You make tables right before my enemies
 You take oil and then you pour it over me
c1: |
 The Lord is my shepherd, I will fear no evil
 You are my shepherd, God, I will fear no evil
b1: |
 Surely goodness and mercy cover me
 All the days of my life they cover me
 Surely i'm going to dwell in the house of the Lord
 Forever and ever and ever and ever more
