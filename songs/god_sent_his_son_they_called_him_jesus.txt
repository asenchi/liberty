v1: |
 God sent His son, they called him Jesus
 He came to love, heal and forgive
 He lived and died to buy my pardon
 An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives
c1: |
 Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
 Because He lives, all fear is gone
 Because I know He holds the future
 And life is worth the living
 Just because He lives
v2: |
 And then one day, I'll cross the river
 I'll fight life's final war with pain
 And then, as death gives way to victory
 I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives
