verse1: |
 Although I am changing, You're unchangeable oh God
 You will be my first love, be my first love
 And for all the changes, that You lead me through oh God
 You will be my first love, be my first love
chorus1: |
 Every morning when the sun comes up
 And every evening when the day is done
 You will be my first love, be my first love
chorus2: |
 Even when you fill my heart's desires
 Even when You're consuming fire
 You will be my first love, be my first love
verse2: |
 Although I am shaken, You're unshakeable oh God
 You will be my first love, be my first love
 So let my idols crumble, You're unshakeable oh God
 You will be my first love, be my first love
bridge: |
 May every day and every way I live bring glory to You Lord
 Be my first love
