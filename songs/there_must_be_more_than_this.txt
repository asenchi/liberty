v1: |
 There must be more than this, O breath of God, come breath within
 There must be more than this, Spriit of God we wait for You
 Fill us anew we pray, fill us anew we pray
c1: |
 Consuming fire fan into flame
 A passion for Your name
 Spirit of God fall in this place
 Lord have Your way, Lord have Your way with us
v2: |
 Come like a rushing wind, clothe us power from on high
 Now set the captives free, leave us abandoned to Your praise
 Lord let Your glory fall, Lord let Your glory fall
