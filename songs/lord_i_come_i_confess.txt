v1: |
 Lord, I come, I confess
 Bowing here I find my rest
 Without You I fall apart
 You're the One that guides my heart
c1: |
 Lord, I need You, Oh, I need You
 Every hour I need You
 My one defense, my righteousness
 Oh God, how I need You
v2: |
 Where sin runs deep Your grace is more
 Where grace is found is where You are
 And where You are, Lord, I am free
 Holiness is Christ in me
b1: |
 Teach my song to rise to You
 When temptation comes my way
 And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You
 Jesus, You're my hope and stay
