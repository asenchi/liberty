v1: |
 Above all powers, above all kings
 Above all nature and all created things
 Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
 You were here
 Before the world began
v2: |
 Above all kingdoms
 Above all thrones
 Above all wonders the world has ever known
 Above all wealth and treasures of the Earth
 There's no way to measure what You're worth
c1: |
 Crucified, laid behind a stone
 You lived to die rejected and alone
 Like a rose trampled on the ground
 You took the fall and thought of me above all
