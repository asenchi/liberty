v1: |
 My Jesus, my Savior
 Lord there is none like You
 All of my days I want to praise
 The wonders of Your mighty love
v2: |
 My comfort, my shelter
 Tower of refuge and strength
 Let every breath, all that I am
 Never cease to worship You
c1: |
 Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing
 Power and majesty, praise to the King
 Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
 At the sound of Your name
 I sing for joy at the work of Your hands
 Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in You
