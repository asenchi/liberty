v1: |
 Man of sorrows, Lamb of God 
 By His own betrayed
 The sin of man and wrath of God
 Has been on Jesus laid
v2: |
 Silent as He stood accused 
 Beaten, mocked and scorned
 Bowing to the Father's will
 He took a crown thorns
v3: |
 Sent of Heaven, God's own Son 
 To purchase and redeem
 And reconcile the very ones 
 Who nailed Him to that tree
v4: |
 See the stone is rolled away
 Behold the empty tomb
 Hallelujah, God be praised
 He's risen from the grave
c1: |
 Oh that rugged cross, my salvation
 Where Your love poured out over me
 Now my soul cries out hallelujah
 Praise and honor unto Thee
b1: |
 Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full
 By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled
 Now the curse of sin, has no hold on me
 Whom the Son sets free, oh is free indeed
