 He is jealous for me
 Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree
 Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy
 When all of a sudden
 I am unaware of these afflicitions eclipsed by glory
 And I realize just how beautiful You are
 And how great Your affections are for me
pc1: |
 And oh, how He loves us oh
 Oh how He loves us
 How He loves us all
c1: |
 He loves us
 Oh how He loves us
 Oh how He loves us
 Oh how He loves
