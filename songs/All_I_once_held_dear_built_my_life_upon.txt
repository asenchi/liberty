v1: |
 All I once held dear, built my life upon
 All this world reveres and wars to own
 All I once thought gain I have counted loss
 Spent and worthless now compared to this
c1: |
 Knowing You, Jesus; Knowing You
 There is no greater thing
 You’re my all; You’re the Best
 You’re my joy my righteousness, and I love You Lord
v2: |
 Now my heart’s desire is to know You more 
 To be found in You and be known as Yours
 To possess by faith what I could not earn 
 All surpassing gift of righteousness
v3: |
 Oh to know the power of Your risen life
 And to know You in Your sufferings
 To become like You in Your death my Lord
 So with You to live and never die
