v1: |
 God is my shepherd, I won't be wanting
 I won't be wanting
 He makes me rest in fields of green
 By quiet streams
 Even though I walk through the valley
 Of death and dying
 I will not fear, cause you are with me
 You're always with me
c1: |
 Your shepherd's staff comforts me
 You are my feast in the presence of enemies
 Surely goodness will follow me
 In the house of God forever
