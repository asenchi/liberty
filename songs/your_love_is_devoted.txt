v1: |
 Your love is devoted like a ring of solid gold
 Like a vow that is tested like a covenant of old
 Your love is enduring through the winter rain
 And beyond the horizon with mercy for today
pc1: |
 Faithful You have been and faithful You will be
 You pledge Yourself to me and it's why I sing
c1: |
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
v2: |
 You Father the orphan
 Your kindness makes us whole
 And You shoulder our weakness
 And Your strength becomes our own
 Now You're making me like You
 Clothing me in white
 Bringing beauty from ashes
 For You will have Your bride
pc2: |
 Free of all her guilt and rid of all her shame
 And known by her true name and it's why I sing
b1: |
 You will be praised, You will be praised
 With angels and saints we sing worthy are you Lord
 And it's why I sing
