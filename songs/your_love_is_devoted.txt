v1: |
 Your love is devoted, like a ring of solid gold
 Like a vow that is tested, like a covenant of old
 Your love is enduring, through the winter rain
 And beyond the horizon, with mercy for today
 Faithful You have been, and faithful You will be
 You pledge yourself to me, and it's why I sing
c1: |
 Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
v2: |
 You father the orphan, Your kindness makes us whole
 You shoulder our weakness, and Your strength becomes our own
 You're making me like you, clothing me in white
 Bringing beauty from ashes, for You will have Your bride
 Free of all her guilt, and rid of all her shame
 And known by her true name, and it's why I sing
b1: |
 You will be praised, You will be praised
 With angels and saints we sing worthy are You Lord
b2: |
 And it's why I sing
