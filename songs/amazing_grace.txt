title: "Amazing Grace"
structure: [v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v1]
v1: |
 Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
 That saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost but now am found,
 Was blind, but now, I see
v2: |
 T'was Grace that taught
 my heart to fear
 And Grace, my fears relieved
 How precious did that Grace appear
 the hour I first believed
v3: |
 Through many dangers, toils and snares
 we have already come
 T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far
 and Grace will lead us home
v4: |
 The Lord has promised good to me
 His word my hope secures
 He will my shield and portion be
 as long as life endures
v5: |
 When we've been here ten thousand years
 bright shining as the sun
 We've no less days to sing God's praise
 then when we've first begun
