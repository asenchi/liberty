v1: |
 The church's one foundation is Jesus Christ her Lord
 She is His new creation by water and the word
 From heav'n He came and sought her to be His holy bride
 With His own blood He bought her, and for her life He died
v2: |
 Elect from ev'ry nation yet one o'er all the earth
 Her charter of salvation, one Lord, one faith, one birth
 One holy name she blesses, partakes one holy food
 And to one hope she presses, with ev'ry grace endued
v3: |
 'Mid toil and tribulation, and tumult of her war
 She waits the consummation of peace for evermore
 'Til with the vision glorious her longing eyes are blessed
 And the great church victorious shall be the church at rest
