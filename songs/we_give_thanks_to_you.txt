 We give thanks to You, O Lord almighty God
 The One who is, who was, and is to come
 You've taken up Your power and begun to reign
 The nations bow before the Holy One

 Now Your salvation and Your power and Your kingdom
 Have all come and You are Lord of all

 The accuser of the brothers has been hurled down forever
 Overcome by the blood, overcome by your blood
 Overcome by the blood of the Lamb
