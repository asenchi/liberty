 As for me I will hope forever
 I will praise You yet more and more
 With my mouth I will tell of Your righteousness
 Your salvation from shore to shore
c1: |
 And I will come with the mighty deeds of God
 I will make known Your Name
 I will tell of Your holy love for me
 And how You love them the same
v2: |
 Oh, God, You have taught me from early age
 Still I will tell of Your wondrous deeds
 Even when Iâ€˜m old, oh, God, give me more of You
 Until my generation sees
