v1: |
 To God be the glory, great things He hath done
 So loved He the world that He gave His son
 Who yielded His life an atonement for sin
 And opened the Life Gate that all may go in
c1: |
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
 Let the earth hear His voice
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
 Let the people rejoice
 Oh, come to the Father, Through Jesus the Son
 And give Him the glory, great things He hath done
v2: |
 Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood
 To every believer the promise of God
 The vilest offender who truly believes
 That moment from Jesus a pardon receives
v3: |
 Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done
 And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son
 But purer, and higher, and greater will be
 Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see
