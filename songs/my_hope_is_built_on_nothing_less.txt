v1: |
 My hope is built on nothing less
 Then Jesus' blood and righteousness
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame
 But wholly trust in Jesus' name
v2: |
 When darkness seems to hide His face
 I rest on His unchanging grace
 In every high and stormy gale
 My anchor holds within the veil
 My anchor holds within the veil
v3: |
 When He shall come with trumpet sound
 Oh may I than in Him be found
 Dressed in His righteousness alone
 Faultless to stand before the throne
c1: |
 Christ alone, cornerstone
 Weak made strong, in the Savior's love
 Through the storm, He is Lord
 Lord of all
