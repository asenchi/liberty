v1: |
 I have been crucified with Christ
 And it's no longer I who live
 For I have died and now my life has been hidden
 With Christ in God
c1: |
 I live by faith, in the Son of God
 I walk by faith, in the Holy One
 I stand by faith, in the King of Kings
 Who loved me and gave Himself for me
 Jesus loved me and gave Himself for me
