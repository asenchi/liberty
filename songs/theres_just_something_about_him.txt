 There's just something about Him, fills my heart with joy
 There's just something about His name
 Only one that I worship, only one I adore
 Only one my heart will praise
 There's just something about His name
v2: |
 He's a river of mercy, He's the fountain of life
 All my sins are washed away
 He's the reason I'm singing, He's my song in the night
 He's been faithful all my days
 There's just something about His name
c1: |
 Jesus, lift up Jesus, sing the name that overcomes
 Savior, He has freed us, lift up Jesus, lift Him up
b1: |
 Holy, holy, the whole earth is filled with His glory
 Holy, holy, worthy of praise
 Holy, holy, all the saints are singing His glory
 Holy, holy, no other name
