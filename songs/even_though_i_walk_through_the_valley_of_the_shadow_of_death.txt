verse1: |
 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
 Your perfect love is casting out fear
 And even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life
 I won't turn back, I know You are near
chorus1: |
 And I will fear no evil
 For my God is with me
 And if my God is with me
 Whom then shall I fear, whom then shall I fear
chorus2: |
 Oh no, You never let go
 Through the calm and through the storm
 Oh no, You never let go
 In every high and every low
 Oh no, You never let go
 Lord, You never let go of me
verse2: |
 I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on
 A glorious light beyond all compare
 There will be an end to these struggles but until that day comes
 We'll know You here on earth
bridge: |
 I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on
 There will be an end to these troubles
 But until that day comes
 Still I will praise You
