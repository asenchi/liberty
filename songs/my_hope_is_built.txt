speed: z
v1: |
 My hope is built on nothing less
 Then Jesus' blood and righteousness
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame
 But wholly lean on Jesus' name
c1: |
 On Christ the solid rock I stand
 All other ground is sinking sand
 All other ground is sinking sand
v2: |
 When Darkness Veils His Lovely face
 I rest on His unchanging grace
 In every high and stormy gale
 My anchor holds within the veil
v3: |
 His oath His covenant His blood
 Support me in the whelming flood
 When all around my soul gives way
 He then is all my hope and stay
v4: |
 When He shall come with trumpet sound
 O I shall then in Him be found
 Dressed in His righteousness alone
 Faultless to stand before the throne
