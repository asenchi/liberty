 Our rights and our freedoms
 Our flags and our kingdoms
 All of our idols must bow
 Our walls and our weapons
 Our wordly possessions
 All of our idols must bow
c1: |
 You have our yes
 That our lives confess, and say
 Jesus is Lord
 We'll take up our cross
 No matter the cost, we say
 Jesus is Lord
v2: |
 Our selfish ambition
 For power and position
 All of our idols must bow
 Our fearful reactions
 And constant distractions
 All of our idols must bow
b1: |
 Our joy is to hope
 Beside Jesus Our Savior
 To love those who hate us
 Embracing our neighbors
 To lay down our lives
 For the poor and the needy
 The cross is our call
 And our only allegiance
 To Jesus, our Lord
 Jesus is Lord
v3: |
 Our holy commitment
 In body and spirit
 To honor You, Jesus, as Lord
 Our love and affection
 Our time and attention
 Lord You deserve it all
 Lord You can have it all
