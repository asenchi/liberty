 Our rights and our freedoms, Our flags and our kingdoms
 All of our idols must bow
 Our walls and our weapons, Our wordly possessions
 All of our idols must bow
c1: |
 You have our yes
 That our lives confess and say, "Jesus is Lord"
 We'll take up our cross
 No matter the cost, we say, "Jesus is Lord"
v2: |
 Our selfish ambition, For power and position
 All of our idols must bow
 Our fearful reactions, And constant distractions
 All of our idols must bow
b1: |
 Our joy is to hope beside Jesus, our Savior
 To love those who hate us, embracing our neighbors
 To lay down our lives for the poor and the needy
 The cross is our call and our only allegiance
 To Jesus, our Lord, To Jesus, our Lord
 Jesus is Lord
v3: |
 Our holy commitment, in body and spirit
 To honor You, Jesus, as Lord
 Our love and affection, Our time and attention
 Lord You deserve it all, Lord You deserve it all, Lord You can have it all
