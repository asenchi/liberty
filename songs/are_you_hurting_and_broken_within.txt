v1: |
 Are you hurting and broken within
 Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin
 Jesus is calling
 Have you come to the end of yourself
 Do you thirst for a drink from the well
 Jesus is calling
c1: |
 Oh come to the altar
 The Father's arms are open wide
 Forgiveness was bought with
 The precious blood of Jesus Christ
v2: |
 Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
 Come today there's no reason to wait
 Jesus is calling
 Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
 From the ashes a new life is born
 Jesus is calling
b1: |
 Oh what a Saviour, isn't He wonderful
 Sing hallelujah Christ is risen
 Bow down before Him, for He is Lord of all
 Sing hallelujah Christ is risen
