 From Heaven to earth our Savior came
 For us on a cross, He bled and died
 And from the cross to an empty grave
 He rose to life, He rose to life

 He lives reigning in power
 He lives Name above all names
 Hallelujah now forever
 Hallelujah Christ is risen
v2: |
 All glory to Him upon the throne
 Forever exalted and seated high
 The Lamb of God He has overcome
 He is alive, He is alive
b1: |
 And on that day with Him I'll rise
 For Christ He lives in me
 This life I live no longer mine
 For Christ He lives in me
