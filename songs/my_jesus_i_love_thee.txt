 My Jesus I love Thee, I know Thou art mine
 For Thee all the follies of sin I resign
 My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou
 If ever I loved thee my Jesus 'tis now

 I love Thee because Thou has first loved me
 And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree
 I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow
 If ever I loved Thee my Jesus 'tis now

 I love you Jesus
 I always will
 Now and forever, I belong to you

 In mansions of glory and endless delight
 I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright
 I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow
 If ever I loved Thee my Jesus tis now
