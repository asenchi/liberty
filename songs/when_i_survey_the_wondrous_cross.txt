v1: |
 When I survey the wondrous cross
 On which the Prince of glory died
 My richest gain I count but loss
 And pour contempt on all my pride
v2: |
 Forbid it Lord, that I should boast
 Save in the death of Christ, my God
 All the vain things that charm me most
 I sacrifice them to His blood
v3: |
 See from His head, His hands, His feet
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down
 Did ever such love and sorrow meet
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown
v4: |
 Were the whole realm of nature mine
 That were a present far too small
 Love so amazing, so divine
 Demands my soul, my life, my all
