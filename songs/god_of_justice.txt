 God of Justice, Saviour to all
 Came to rescue the weak and the poor
 Chose to serve and not be served

 Jesus, You have called us
 Freely we've received now freely we will give

 Stand beside the broken, we must go
 Stepping forward keep us from just singing
 Move us into action, we must go

 To act justly everyday
 Loving mercy in everyway
 Walking humbly before You God

 You have shown us, what You require
 Freely we've received now freely we will give

 Fill us up and send us out
 Fill us up and send us out
 Fill us up and send us out Lord
