title: "Where Do I Go"
structure: [[v1,c1],[v2,c1],[b1,c1]]
inkey: z
speed: fast
v1: |
 Where do I go when I feel so low
 I can hardly see the sun
 Where do I go when I feel alone
 Just like David on the run
 Where do I go when my heart explodes
 With a song that can't be sung
 Where do I go? Here's where I go
 To the mountain of the Lord
c1: |
 Rejoice, rejoice!
 Our God is king of everything
 Rejoice, rejoice!
 The world is in his hands
 Lift up your voice
 And love your God with all your heart, rejoice!
v2: |
 Where do I go with a thankful heart
 That can feel his love abound
 How do I thank my provisioner
 For the manna on the ground
 What can I sing as an offering
 Like a bird making it's call
 Here's what I sing praise to the king
 He's the one that's over all
b1: |
 Lord in every circumstance we'll praise you
 Lord every day we'll call your name
 And you'll always lift us up
 And you'll always lift us up
 And we'll sing and shout your praise for ever more
