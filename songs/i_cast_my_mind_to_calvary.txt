speed: z
v1: |
 I cast my mind to Calvary
 Where Jesus bled and died for me
 I see His wounds, His hands, His feet
 My Savior on that cursed tree
v2: |
 His body bound and drenched in tears
 They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb
 The entrance sealed by heavy stone
 Messiah still and all alone
v3: |
 Then on the third at break of dawn
 The Son of heaven rose again
 O trampled death where is your sting?
 The angels roar for Christ the King
v4: |
 He shall return in robes of white
 The blazing Son shall pierce the night
 And I will rise among the saints
 My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face
c1: |
 O praise the name of the Lord our God
 O praise His name forevermore
 For endless days we will sing Your praise
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God
