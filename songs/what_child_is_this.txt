c1: |
 This, this is Christ the king
 Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
 Haste, haste to bring Him laud
 The babe, the son of Mary
c2: |
 Nails, spear shall pierce Him through
v1: |
 What child is this who laid to rest
 On Mary's lap is sleeping
 Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
 While shepherds watch are keeping
v2: |
 Why lies He in such mean estate
 Where ox and ass are feeding
 The end of fear for all who hear
 The silent Word is speaking
v3: |
 So bring him incense, gold and myrrh
 Come peasant king to love Him;
 The king of kings salvation brings
 Let loving hearts enthrone Him
