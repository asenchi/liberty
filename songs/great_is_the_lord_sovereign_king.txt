 Great is the Lord, sovereign king
 We give You praise

 You spoke the word and You rescued me
 You poured out Your grace and you set me free
 Now You've filled my life with the Spirit's power
 And You've set my heart on fire

 And by the power of Jesus' name
 You have raised me up from my sin and shame
 You've annointed me with the Spirit's power
 And You've set my heart on fire

 By grace I'm saved through faith in God
 Not by my works but by Jesus' blood
 Now I'm filled with strength by Spirit's power
 And You've set my heart on fire
