 Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature
 O Thou of God and Man the Son Thee will I cherish,
 Thee will I honor
 Thou my soul’s glory, joy, and crown

 Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands
 Robed in the blooming garb of spring
 Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer
 Who makes the woeful heart to sing

 Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight
 And all the twinkling starry host
 Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
 Than all the angels Heav’n can boast

 Beautiful Savior! Lord of the nations
 Son of God and Son of Man
 Glory and honor, praise, adoration
 Now and forevermore be Thine
