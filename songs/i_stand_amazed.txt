v1: |
 I stand amazed in the presence
 Of Jesus the Nazarene
 And wonder how He could love me
 A sinner, condemned, unclean
c1: |
 How marvelous, how wonderful
 And my song shall ever be
 How marvelous, how wonderful
 Is my Savior's love for me
v2: |
 He took my sins and my sorrows
 He made them His very own
 He bore the burden to calvary
 And suffered and died alone
v3: |
 When with the ransomed in glory
 His face I at last shall see
 'twill be my joy through the ages
 To sing of His love for me
