￼For this purpose Christ was revealed
 To destroy all the works of the evil one
 Christ in us has overcome
 So with gladness we sing
 And welcome His kingdom in

 Over sin He has conquered (Hallelujah, He has conquered)
 Over death, victorious (Hallelujah, victorious)
 Over sickness He has triumphed (Hallelujah, He has triumphed)

 We now claim this ground, Satan has no authority here
 Clouds of darkness must flee, for Christ has the victory

 Jesus reigns over all
 Jesus reigns over all
