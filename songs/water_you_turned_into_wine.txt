verse1: |
 Water You turned into wine
 Opened the eyes of the blind
 There's no one like You
 None like You
verse2: |
 Into the darkness You shine
 Out of the ashes we rise
 There's no one like You
 None like You
chorus: |
 Our God is greater, our God is stronger
 God You are higher than any other
 Our God is Healer, awesome in power
 Our God, our God
bridge: |
 And if our God is for us, then who could ever stop us
 And if our God is with us, then who could stand against
 And if our God is for us, then who could ever stop us
 And if our God is with us, then who could stand against
 Who could stand against
