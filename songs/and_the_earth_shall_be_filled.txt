 And the earth shall be filled
 With the knowledge of the glory of the Lord
 Just like the waters cover the sea
 And the earth shall be filled
 With the knowledge of the glory of the Lord
 Just like the waters cover the sea

 Lifting up a standard for the nations
 To demonstrate the purpose of His kingdom
 His people unashamed to proclaim His name
 As the fullness of the Lord fills all in all
