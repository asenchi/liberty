v1: |
 Gracious understanding
 God’s love so confounding appears to us
 In a cleansing flow of blood
 The Son left throne and glory
 Bore the Father’s wrath and fury in our stead
 And for the sins of all He bled
c1: |
 We stand in awe in worship
 We raise our voice in worship We adore
 The King of Kings and Lord of Lords
v2: |
 Behold the Lamb in heaven
 He was dead but God raised Him from the grave
 For His arm is mighty to save
 Now glorified and reigning
 The keys to death and Hades in His hand
 All hail the Lord of every land
