v1: |
 You are good, You are good 
 When there's nothing good in me
 You are love, You are love 
 On display for all to see
 You are light, You are light 
 When the darkness closes in
 You are hope, You are hope 
 You have covered all my sin
v2: |
 You are peace, You are peace 
 When my fear is crippling
 You are true, You are true 
 Even in my wandering
 You are joy, You are joy 
 You're the reason that I sing
 You are life, You are life, 
 In You death has lost its sting
c1: |
 Oh, I'm running to Your arms, I'm running to Your arms
 The riches of Your love will always be enough
 Nothing compares to Your embrace 
 Light of the world forever reign
v3: |
 You are more, You are more 
 Than my words will ever say
 You are Lord, You are Lord 
 All creation will proclaim
 You are here, You are here 
 In Your presence I'm made whole
 You are God, You are God 
 Of all else I'm letting go
b1: |
 My heart will sing no other Name Jesus, Jesus
