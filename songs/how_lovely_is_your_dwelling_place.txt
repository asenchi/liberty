verse1: |
 How lovely is Your dwelling place
 Oh Lord Almighty
 My soul longs and even faints for You
verse2: |
 For here my heart is satisfied
 Within Your presence
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings
chorus: |
 Better is one day in Your courts
 Better is one day in Your house
 Better is one day in Your courts
 Than thousands elsewhere

 One thing I ask and I would seek
 To see Your beauty
 To find You in the place Your glory dwells
verse4: |
 My heart and flesh cry out
 For You the living God
 Your spirit's water for my soul
verse5: |
 I've tasted and I've seen
 Come once again to me
 I will draw near to You
