 How lovely is Your dwelling place
 Oh Lord Almighty
 My soul longs and even faints for You
verse2: |
 For here my heart is satisfied
 Within Your presence
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings

 Better is one day in Your courts
 Better is one day in Your house
 Better is one day in Your courts
 Than thousands elsewhere

 One thing I ask and I would seek
 To see Your beauty
 To find You in the place Your glory dwells
