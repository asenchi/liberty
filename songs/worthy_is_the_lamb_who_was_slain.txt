verse1: |
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
 Holy Holy is He
 Sing a new song
 To Him who sits on
 Heaven's mercy seat
chorus: |
 Holy Holy Holy
 Is the Lord God Almighty
 Who was and is and is to come
 With all creation I sing
 Praise to the King of Kings
 You are my everything
 And I will adore you
verse2: |
 Clothed in rainbow of living color
 Flashes of lightning rolls of thunder
 Blessing and honor
 Strength and glory and power be
 To You the only wise King
verse3: |
 Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
 At the mention of Your Name
 Jesus Your Name is power
 Breath and living water
 Such a marvelous mystery
