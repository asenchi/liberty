v1: |
 Come out of sadness from wherever you've been
 Come, broken hearted let rescue begin
 Come find your mercy, O sinner, come kneel
 Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
 Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
v2: |
 There's hope for the hopeless, and all those who've strayed
 Come sit at the table, come taste the grace
 There's rest for the weary, rest that endures
 Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't cure
v3: |
 There's joy for the morning, O sinner, be still
 Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
 Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
c1: |
 Lay down your burdens, lay down your shame
 All who are broken, lift up your face
 O wanderer, come home, you're not too far
 So lay down your hurt, lay down your heart
 Come as you are
