v1: |
 You are the Lord and You reign on high
 You are the Lord
 Spoke into darkness, created the light
 You are the Lord
 Who is like unto You, never ending in days
 You are the Lord
 And You come in power when we call on Your name
 You are the Lord
c1: |
 God of power, we call on Your name
 God of power, forever the same
v2: |
 Your gospel, O Lord, is the hope for our nation
 You are the Lord
 It's the power of God for our salvation
 You are the Lord
 We ask not for riches but look to the cross
 You are the Lord
 And for our inheritence give us the lost
 You are the Lord
