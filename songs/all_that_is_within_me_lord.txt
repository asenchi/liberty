￼All that is within me Lord
 Will bless Your Holy name
 I live my life to worship You alone
 You brought me out of darkness and into Your glorious light
 Forever I will sing of Your great love
 Forever I will sing of Your great love

 I love to see You glorified
 To see You lifted high
 I yearn to see all nations bow their knee
 It’s You alone Lord Jesus
 Who can cause the coldest heart
 To find Your love and everlasting peace

 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord 
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord
