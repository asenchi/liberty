v1: |
 You call me out upon the waters
 The great unknown where feet may fail
 And there I find You in the mystery
 In oceans deep
 My faith will stand
c1: |
 And I will call upon Your name
 And keep my eyes above the waves
 When oceans rise
 My soul will rest in Your embrace
 For I am Yours and You are mine
v2: |
 Your grace abounds in deepest waters
 Your sovereign hand
 Will be my guide
 Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
 You've never failed and You won't start now
c2: |
 So I will call upon Your name
 And keep my eyes above the waves
 When oceans rise
 My soul will rest in Your embrace
 For I am Yours and You are mine
b1: |
 Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
 Let me walk upon the waters
 Wherever You would call me
 Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
 And my faith will be made stronger
 In the presence of my Savior
c3: |
 I will call upon Your name
 Keep my eyes above the waves
 My soul will rest in Your embrace
 I am Yours and You are mine
