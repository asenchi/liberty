speed: z
v1: |
 When peace like a river attendeth my way
 When sorrows like sea billows roll
 Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
 It is well, it is well, with my soul
v2: |
 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
 Let this blest assurance control
 That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
 And hath shed His own blood for my soul
v3: |
 My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought
 My sin, not in part but the whole
 Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, o my soul
v4: |
 And, Lord haste the day when the faith shall be sight
 The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
 The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend
 Even so, it is well with my soul
c1: |
 It is well (it is well)
 With my soul (with my soul)
 It is well, it is well with my soul
