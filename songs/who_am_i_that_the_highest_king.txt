v1: |
 Who am I that the highest King
 Would welcome me
 I was lost but He brought me in
 Oh His love for me, Oh His love for me
c1: |
 Who the Son sets free, Oh is free indeed
 I'm a child of God, Yes I am
v2: |
 Free at last, He has ransomed me
 His grace runs deep
 While I was a slave to sin
 Jesus died for me, Yes He died for me
c2: |
 Who the Son sets free, Oh is free indeed
 I'm a child of God, Yes I am
 In my Father's house, There's a place for me
 I'm a child of God, Yes I am
b1: |
 I am chosen, not forsaken
 I am who You say I am
 You are for me not against me
 I am who You say I am
