v1: |
 There's never been a time like this for us to server God's purpose
 No time like the present to work the works of God
 A living demonstration of the nature of God's kingdom
 Abounding in the good deeds of our God
c1: |
 For such a time as this we have been commissioned
 Called to be an army in the service of our God
 For such a time as this we have been found willing
 Willing, able servants of our God
v2: |
 Not only are we chosen to serve our Father's purpose
 To tell this generation of the coming of our King
 He's called us to be righteous, holy, pure and blameless
 A temple thats befitting for a king
v3: |
 In the midst of darkness the light of God arises
 Proclaiming to the nations that Jesus is the King
 He's captured the affections of men from every nation
 Who love to do the bidding of their King
