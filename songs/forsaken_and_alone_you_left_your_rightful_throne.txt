verse1: |
 Forsaken and alone You left Your rightful throne
 You sacrificed Yourself to give us freedom
 They looked for You one day
 They found an empty grave
 The resurrected Savior gave us freedom
pc: |
 Lord we don't deserve the banquet that You serve
 The wages of our sin had been foretold
chorus: |
 Your grace is freedom from all the snares that bind us
 And all we do is call upon Your name
 Your grace is freedom
 To live the life You've planned for us
 And by Your grace we'll walk with You today
verse2: |
 We're santified and saved, You washed away the stain
 You purified us now we live in freedom
 You help us turn away
 From darkness, sin, and pain
 Your Spirit guides us as we live in freedom
bridge: |
 Oh God, give us strength, give us grace, give us love
 Oh God, live within our hearts
