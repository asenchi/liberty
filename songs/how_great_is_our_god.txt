 How great is our God, sing with me how great is our God
 And all will see, how great, how great is our God

 The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty
 Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice
 He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide
 And trembles at His voice and trembles at His voice

 And age to age He stands, and time is in His hands
 Beginning and the end, beginning and the end
 The Godhead three in one, Father, Spirit, Son
 The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb

 And all will see, how great, how great are You Lord
