 Joyful, joyful we adore thee
 God of glory Lord of love
 Hearts unfold like flowers before You
 Opening to the sun above
v1b: |
 Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
 Drive the dark of doubt away
 Giver of immortal gladness
 Fill us with the light of day
v2a: |
 All Thy works with joy surround Thee
 Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays
 Stars and angels sing around Thee
 Center of unbroken praise
v2b: |
 Field and forest vale and mountain
 Flowery meadow flashing sea
 Singing bird and flowing fountain
 Call us to rejoice in Thee
v3a: |
 Thou art giving and forgiving
 Ever blessing ever blessed
 Wellspring of the joy of living
 Ocean depth of happy rest

 Thou our Father Christ our Brother
 All who live in love are Thine
 Teach us how to love each other
 Lift us to the joy divine

 Mortals join the happy chorus
 Which the morning stars began
 Father love is reigning over us
 Brother love binds man to man

 Ever singing march we onward
 Victors in the midst of strife
 Joyful music leads us sunward
 in the triumph song of life
