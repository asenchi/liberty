v1: |
 Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness
 Opened my eyes, let me see
 Beauty that made this heart adore You
 Hope of a life spent with You
c1: |
 Here I am to worship; here I am to bow down
 Here I am to say that You're my God
 And Youâ€™re altogether lovely, altogether worthy
 Altogether wonderful to me
v2: |
 King of all days, oh so highly exalted
 Glorious in Heaven above
 Humbly You came to the earth You created
 All for love's sake became poor
b1: |
 I'll never know how much it cost
 To see my sin upon that cross
