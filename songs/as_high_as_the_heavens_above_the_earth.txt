v1: |
 As high as the heavens are above the earth
 So great is the Fatherâ€™s love
 As far as the east is from the west
 So far has He taken our sin from us
v2: |
 For His anger lasts only a moment
 But His favor lasts for a lifetime
 Weeping may remain for a night
 But rejoicing comes, it comes in the morning
