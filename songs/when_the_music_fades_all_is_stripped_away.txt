v1: |
 When the music fades, all is stripped away
 And I simply come
 Longing just to bring something that's of worth
 That will bless Your heart
v2: |
 King of endless worth, no one could express
 How much You deserve
 Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours
 Every single breath
pc1: |
 I'll bring You more than a song
 For a song in itself
 Is not what You have required
 You search much deeper within
 Through the way things appear
 You're looking into my heart
c1: |
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship
 And it's all about You
 It's all about You, Jesus
 I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it
 When it's all about You
 It's all about You, Jesus
