v1: |
 Crown Him with many crowns
 The Lamb upon His throne
 Hark! How the Heav'nly anthem drowns
 All music but its own
 Awake my soul and sing
 Of Him who died for thee
 And hail Him as thy matchless King
 Through all eternity
v2: |
 Crown Him the Lord of life
 Who triumphed o'er the grave
 And rose victorious in the strife
 For those He came to save
 His glories now we sing
 Who died and rose on high
 Who died eternal life to bring
 And lives that death may die
v3: |
 Crown Him the Lord of Heav'n
 Enthroned in worlds above
 Crown Him the King to whom is giv'n
 The wondrous name of love
 Crown Him with many crowns
 As thrones before Him fall
 Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns
 Fore He is King of all
v4: |
 Crown Him the Lord of love
 Behold His hands and side
 Those wounds, yet visible above
 In beauty glorified
 All hail, Redeemer, hail
 For Thou has died for me
 Thy praise and glory shall not fail
 Throughout eternity
