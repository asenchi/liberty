verse1: |
 The greatest day in history
 Death is beaten, You have rescued me
 Sing it out, Jesus is alive
 The empty cross, the empty grave
 Life eternal, You have won the day
 Shout it out, Jesus is alive, He's alive
chorus: |
 Oh, happy day, happy day, You washed my sin away
 Oh, happy day, happy day, I'll never be the same
 Forever I am changed
verse2: |
 When I stand in that place
 Free at last, meeting face to face
 I am Yours, Jesus, You are mine
 Endless joy, perfect peace
 Earthly pain finally will cease
 Celebrate, Jesus is alive, He's alive
bridge: |
 Oh, what a glorious day, what a glorious way
 That You have saved me
 Oh, what a glorious day, what a glorious Name
