 O come, o come, Emmanuel and ransom captive Israel
 That mourns in lonely exile here
 Until the Son of God appear
c1: |
 Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
 Shall come to Thee O Israel

 O come, O come, Thou lord of might
 Who to Thy tribes on Sinai's height
 In ancient times didst give the law
 In cloud and majesty and awe

 O come, Thou rod of Jesse, free
 Thine own from Satan's tyranny
 From depths of hell Thy people save
 And give them victory o'er the grave
