v1: |
 Great God of might, great God of wonders
 Giver of life, giver of grace
 Creator of everything before us
 You had me in mind before the stars were in place
pc1: |
 Your love surpasses all by far
 We're praising You for all You are
c1: |
 The reason we're here and the reason we sing
 Is to thank You, oh God, and give praise to the King
 We lift up our hearts, and we lift up our eyes, and we sing
 You are holy
v2: |
 Father of love, Father of mercy
 What have I done that You would think about me
 You've taken my shame, You've taken my sorrow
 You've given me life and life abundantly
