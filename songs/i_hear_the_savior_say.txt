v1: |
 I hear the Savior say
 Thy strength indeed is small
 Child of weakness watch and pray
 Find in me thine all in all
c1: |
 'Cause Jesus paid it all
 All to Him I owe
 Sin had left a crimson stain
 He washed it white as snow
b1: |
 Oh praise the One who paid my debt and
 Raise this life up from the dead
v2: |
 Lord now indeed I find
 Thy power and thine alone
 Can change the lepers spots
 And melt the heart of stone
v3: |
 And when before the throne
 I stand in Him complete
 Jesus died my soul to save
 My lips shall still repeat
