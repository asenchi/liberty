 Wonderful, so wonderful
 Is Your unfailing love
 Your cross has spoken mercy over me
 No eye has seen, no ear has heard
 No heart can fully know
 How glorious, how beautiful You are

 Beautiful One I love
 Beautiful One I adore
 Beautiful One my soul must sing
v2: |
 Powerful so powerful
 Your glory fills the skies
 Your mighty works displayed for all to see
 The beauty of Your majesty awakes my heart to sing
 How marvelous how wonderful You are

 You opened my eyes to Your wonders anew
 You captured my heart with this love
 Because nothing on earth is as beautiful as You
