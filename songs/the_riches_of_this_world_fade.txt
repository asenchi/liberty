v1: |
 The riches of this world will fade
 The treasures of our God remain
 Here I empty myself
 To owe this world nothing
 And find everything in You
v2: |
 Take my life I sacrifice
 And You alone I'm satisfied
 Here I empty myself
 To owe this world nothing
 And find everything in You, everything in You
c1: |
 I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
 All to you
b1: |
 Not my will but Yours be done
 Not my strength but Yours alone
 Nothing else but You oh Lord
 I find everything in You
