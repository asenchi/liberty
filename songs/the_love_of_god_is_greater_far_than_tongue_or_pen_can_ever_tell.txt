v1: |
  The love of God is greater far, than tongue or pen can ever tell
  It goes beyond the highest star, and reaches to the lowest hell
  The guilty pair bowed down with care, God gave his Son to win
  His erring child he reconciled, and pardoned every sin
v2: |
  When time at last shall pass away, and earthly thrones and kingdoms fall
  When those who here refuse to pray, on rocks and hills and mountains call
  God's love, so sure, shall still endure, all measureless and strong
  Redeeming grace to Adam's race, the saints' and angels' song
v3: |
  Could we with ink the ocean fill, and were the skies of parchment made
  Were every stalk on earth a quill, and everyone a scribe by trade
  To write the love of God above, would drain the ocean dry
  Nor could the scroll contain the whole, though stretched from sky to sky
c1: |
  O love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong
  It shall forevermore endure, the saints' and angels' song
