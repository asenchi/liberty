v1: |
 I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like
 But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
 You tell me that You're pleased and that I'm never alone
c1: |
 You're a good, good Father
 It's who You are, it's who You are, it's who You are
 And I'm loved by You, it's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am
v2: |
 I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
 But I know we're all searching for answers only You provide because
 You know just what we need before we say a word
b1: |
 You are perfect in all of Your ways
 You are perfect in all of Your ways
 You are perfect in all of Your ways
 You are perfect in all of Your ways to us
v3: |
 This Love so undeniable, I can hardly speak
 Peace so unexplainable, I can hardly think
 As you call me deeper still
 As you call me deeper still
 As you call me deeper still into love, your love
