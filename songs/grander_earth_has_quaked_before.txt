v1: |
 Grander earth has quaked before
 Moved by the sound of His voice
 Seas that are shaken and stirred
 Can be calmed and broken for my regard
v2: |
 Far be it for me to not believe
 Even when my eyes can't see
 And this mountain that's in front of me
 Will be thrown into the midst of sea
c1: |
 Through it all, through it all
 My eyes are on You
 Through it all, through it all
 It is well
 Through it all, through it all
 My eyes are on You
 It is well with me
b1: |
 So let go my soul and trust in Him
 The waves and wind still know His name
 So let go my soul and trust in Him
 The waves and wind still know His name
o1: |
 It is well with my soul
 It is well with my soul
 It is well with my soul
 It is well, it is well with my soul
