v1: |
 When I'm feeling cold and lonely and I need a friend
 When the thorns have snared me tightly, darkness closes in
 Still I know He is good and He's holding my hand
 And He's lifting me up 'till I see light again
v2: |
 Is your garden over-growing, have the weeds come in
 Has your heart been slowly hardened by the ways of sin
 But our God will restore and our God will forgive
 And is grace is enough in His grace we can live
pc1: |
 Jesus can you come and take us higher
 Lift us up as we praise Your name
 Bring Your spirit Lord, come and fill us
 Come and hear us Lord as we sing
c1: |
 Our God is reigning from His throne of grace
 Let us draw near to His merciful face
 Jesus has risen victorious o'er sin
 High priest, our savior He's drawing us in
b1: |
 God of light, God of mercy
 God of justice, God of grace
 Holy Spirit draw us closer
 Fill us up in Your embrace
