v1: |
 Before I spoke a word
 You were singing over me
 You have been so, so good to me
 Before I took a breath
 You breathed Your life in me
 You have been so, so kind to me
v2: |
 When I was Your foe
 Still Your love fought for me
 You have been so, so good to me
 When I felt no worth
 You paid it all for me
 You have been so, so kind to me
c1: |
 Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending
 Reckless love of God
 Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found
 Leaves the ninety-nine
 I couldn't earn it, I don't deserve it
 Still You give Yourself away
 Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending
 Reckless love of God
b1: |
 There's no shadow You won't light up
 Mountain You won't climb up
 Coming after me
 There's no wall You won't kick down
 Lie You won't tear down
 Coming after me
