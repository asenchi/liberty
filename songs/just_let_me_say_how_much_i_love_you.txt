 Just let me say how much I love You
 Let me speak of Your mercy and grace
 Just let me live in a shadow of Your beauty
 Let me see You face to face

 And the earth will shake as Your Word goes forth
 And the heavens will tremble and fall
 But let me say how much I love You
 Oh my Savior, my Lord and Friend

 As You gently call my name
 And let me see Your power and Your glory
 Let me feel Your spirit's flame

 Let me find You in the desert
 Till this sand is holy ground
 And I am found completely surrendered
 To You my Lord and Friend

 With all my heart I long for You
 For I am caught in this passion of knowing
 This endless love I've found in You

 And the depth of grace, the forgiveness found
 To be called a child of God
 Just makes me say how much I love You
 Oh my Savior, my Lord and Friend
