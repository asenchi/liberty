v1: |
 Savior I come
 Quiet my soul, remember
 Redemption's hill
 Where Your blood was spilled
 For my ransom
v2: |
 You were as I
 Tempted and trialed
 Human
 The Word became flesh
 Bore my sin and death
 Now You're risen
pc1: |
 Everything I once held dear
 I count it all as lost
c1: |
 Lead me to the cross
 Where Your love poured out
 Bring me to my knees
 Lord I lay me down
 Rid me of myself
 I belong to You
 Lead me, lead me to the cross
b1: |
 To Your heart
 To Your heart
 Lead me to Your heart
 Lead me to Your heart
