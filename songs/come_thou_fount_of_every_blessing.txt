v1: |
 Come Thou fount of every blessing
 Tune my heart to sing Your grace
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing
 Call for songs of loudest praise
 Teach me some melodious sonnet
 Sung by flaming tongues above
 Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it
 Mount of Thy unchanging love
v2: |
 Thus far Your love has blessed me
 You have brought me to this place
 And I know Your hand will lead me
 Safely home by Your good grace
 Jesus sought me when a stranger
 Wandering from the fold of God
 He, to rescue me from danger
 Bought me with His precious blood
v3: |
 O to grace how great a debtor
 Daily I’m convinced it’s true
 Let that grace now, like a fetter
 Bind my wandering heart to You
 Was prone to wander, 'fore I knew you
 Prone to leave the God I love
 Here’s my heart Lord, take and seal it
 Seal it for Your courts above
