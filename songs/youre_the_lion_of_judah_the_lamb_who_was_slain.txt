v1: |
 You're the Lion of Judah, the Lamb who was slain
 You ascended to heaven and evermore will reign
 At the end of the age when the earth You reclaim
 You will gather the nations before You
 And the eyes of all men will be fixed on the Lamb
 Who was crucified
 With wisdom and mercy and justice
 You'll reign at Your Father's side
c1: |
 And the angels will cry
 Hail the Lamb who was slain for the world
 Rule in power
 And the earth will reply
 You shall reign as the King of all kings and the
 Lord of all lords
v2: |
 There's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side
 There's a fire in our spirits that cannot be denied
 'Cause the Father has told us for these You have died
 For the nations that gather before You
 And the ears of all men need to hear of the Lamb
 Who was crucified
 Who defeated the grave and was raised up to reign
 At His Father's side
