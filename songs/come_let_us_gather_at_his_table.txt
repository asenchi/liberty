v1: |
 Come let us gather at His table
 Let's remember all the Lord has done
 How He offered Himself freely
 So we all could stand here now as one
c1: |
 Holy is the Lord our Savior
 Let us praise His name together
 Holy is the Lord our Maker, Holy is His name forever
 Holy is the Lord
v2: |
 Come let us gather at His feet now
 See the nail scars as we bow in praise
 How could one so pure and tender
 Suffer death so we could stand in grace
