 I will run in the path of Your commands oh Lord
 For you have set my heart free
 I will run in the paths of Your commands oh Lord
 For you have been gracious to me
 I will give my body as a living sacrifice
 Which is the way that I worship You
 I won't be conformed into the image of this world
 But my mind will be renewed by the washing of Your word
