v1: |
 I know He rescued my soul
 His blood covered my sin
 I believe, I believe
 My shame He's taken away
 My pain is healed in His name
 I believe, I believe
pc1: |
 I'll raise a banner
 'Cause my Lord has conquered the grave
c1: |
 My Redeemer lives, my Redeemer lives
 My Redeemer lives, my Redeemer lives
 My Redeemer lives, my Redeemer lives
b1: |
 You lift my burdens
 I'll rise with You
 I'm dancing on this mountaintop
 To see Your kingdom come
