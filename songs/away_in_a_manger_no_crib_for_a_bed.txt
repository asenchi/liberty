v1: |
 Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
 The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
 The stars in the sky looked down where He lay
 The Little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
v2: |
 The cattle are lowing the baby awakes
 But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
 I love Thee, Lord Jesus look down from the sky
 And stay by my cradle â€˜til morning is nigh
v3: |
 Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
 Close by me forever, and love me, I pray
 Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
 And fit us for heaven to live with Thee there.
