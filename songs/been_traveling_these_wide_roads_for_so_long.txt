 Been traveling these wide roads for so long
 My heart's been far from You, ten thousand miles gone
 Oh, I wanna come near and give ya every part of me
 But there's blood on my hands, and my lips aren't clean
v2: |
 Dip me in Your smooth waters I go in
 As a man with many crimes, come up for air
 As my sins flow down the Jordan
 Oh, I wanna come near and give ya every part of me
 But there's blood on my hands, and my lips aren't clean
pc1: |
 In my darkness I remember
 Momma's words reoccur to me
 Surrender to the good Lord
 And He'll wipe your slate clean
c1: |
 Take me to Your river, I wanna go
 Oh, go on take me to Your river, I wanna know
b1: |
 I wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
 I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
