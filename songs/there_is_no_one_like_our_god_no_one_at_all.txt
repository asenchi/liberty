speed: z
v1: |
 There's no one like our god, no one at all
 He gave His Son for us
 Jesus the Lord
 Who can love us like He does
 No one at all
 Oh how we love you Lord
c1: |
 You are high above all nations
 Your glory shines above the heavens
 Humbled yourself to love and save us
 Be praised through endless generations
c2: |
 You lift the needy from the ashes
 And seat them high up with the princes
 You give the barren woman healing
 She'll dance for joy like the mother of children
