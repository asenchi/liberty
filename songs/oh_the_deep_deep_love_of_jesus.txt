v1: |
 Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
 Vast unmeasured boundless free
 Rolling as a mighty ocean
 In its fullness over me
v2: |
 Underneath me all around me
 Is the courage of His love
 Leading Homeward leading homeward
 To Thy glorious rest above
v3: |
 Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
 Tis a heaven of heavens to me
 And it lifts me up to glory
 For it lifts me up to Thee
v4: |
 Oh the deep, deep love of Jesus
 Spread His praise from shore to shore
 How He loveth, ever loveth
 Changeth never, nevermore
