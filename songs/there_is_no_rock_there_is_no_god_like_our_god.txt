 There is no rock, there is no God like our God
 No other name worthy of all our praise
 The Rock of salvation who cannot be moved
 He's proven Himself to be faithful and true
 There is no rock, there is no God like ours

 Rock of ages, Jesus is the Rock
 Rock of ages, Jesus is the Rock
 Rock of ages, Jesus is the Rock
 There is no rock, there is no God like ours
