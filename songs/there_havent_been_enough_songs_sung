v1: |
 There haven't been enough songs sung
 We haven't run out of praise
 In fact we've only just begun
 We'll be singing for all our days
 We're joining with the angels now
 As they worship before Your throne
 And though we love to praise You here
 We can't wait 'til we get home
c1: |
 We love to be in Your presence, we love to give You praise
 We love to worship before You, we'll worship You all our days
v2: |
 There haven't been enough things said
 To describe how great You are
 There'll never be enough words written
 To explain Your awesome power
 We're joining with the angels now
 As they worship before Your throne
 And though we love to praise You here
 We can't wait 'till we get home
