 The fullness of Your grace is here with me
 The richness of Your beauty's all I see
 The brightness of Your glory has arrived
 In Your presence God I'm completely satisfied

 For You I sing I dance
 Rejoice in this divine romance
 Lift my heart and my hands
 To show my love, to show my love

 A deep deep flood, an ocean flows from You
 Of deep deep love, yeah it's filling up the room
 Your innocent blood, has washed my guilty life
 In Your presence God I'm completely satisfied
