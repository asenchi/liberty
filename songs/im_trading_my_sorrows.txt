v1: |
 I'm trading my sorrows
 I'm trading my shame
 I'm laying them down
 For the joy of the Lord
 I'm trading my sickness
 I'm trading my plan
 I'm laying them down
 For the joy of the Lord
b1: |
 I am pressed but not crushed
 Persecuted not abandoned
 Struck down but not destroyed
 I am blessed beyond the curse
 For his promise will endure
 That his joy's gonna be my strength
 Though the sorrow may last for the night
 His joy comes in the morning
c1: |
 We say yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord
 Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord
 Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord Amen
