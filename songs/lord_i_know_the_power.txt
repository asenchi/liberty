v1: |
 Lord I know the power of the blood of the Lamb
 The cleansing flow from Calvary to redeem fallen man
 Though You were rejected
 And Your love was more than tested
 You carried on
v2: |
 Lord You left Your Father, You came to set men free
 To give me life You laid Yours down as a ransom just for me
 Jesus I’m so grateful that Your love’s been more than faithful
c1: |
 Lord Your grace is still amazing
 Lord Your grace is still amazing
 Lord Your grace is still amazing, amazing to me
v3: |
 Even though desires, try to lead us far away
 Your Spirit draws us back to You so that we will not stray
 Even in our weakness, Lord Your love can always keep us
