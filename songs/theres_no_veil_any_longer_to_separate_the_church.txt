v1: |
 There's no veil any longer to separate the church
 From the presence of the Lord, there's no veil any longer
 We enter with sincere and grateful hearts
v2: |
 Lord we come into Your courts with a sacrifice of praise
 Lord we come in confidence with a sacrifice of praise
 Creator of all heaven and earth, we are wonderfully made
c1: |
 Lord of all the universe, we are gloriously saved
 Boldly we approach the throne
 We are Yours and not our own
 For who You are, for what You've done, we worship You
