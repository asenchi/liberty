 Creation cries out with your praise
 We call out your name in the morning

 We join with the voices of ancients
 In a chorus that lifts up your name
 Your mercy and love we proclaim

 Your love is a shelter at night
 Your word is a lamp in the darkness
 And you are the light

 You are the God of the ages

 Great is the Lord
 Great are you Lord
 Great is the Lord
 Great are you Lord
