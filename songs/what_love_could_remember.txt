v1: |
 What love could remember, no wrongs we have done
 Omniscient, all-knowing, He counts not their sum
 Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
 Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
v2: |
 What patience would wait as we constantly roam
 What father so tender is calling us home
 He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor
 Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
v3: |
 What riches of kindness He lavished on us
 His blood was the payment, His life was the cost
 We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford
 Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
c1: |
 Praise the Lord, His mercy is more
 Stronger than darkness, new every morn
 Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
