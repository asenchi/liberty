 Your mercies are new every morning
 Your grace for me every day
 Your love never failing
 Your Spirit to guide me when all I feel is pain
v2: |
 God let Your love come surround me
 You will be my peace in the storm
 I will strust in the rock Abba Father above
 You will never leave me alone
v3: |
 When I feel lost in the darkness or when things look bright
 I will trust in You God I will fight this good fight
 For when my strength fails, beginning to let go
 Lord You suffered my sin so that I'd be made new
c1: |
 Oh Lord You are faithful, so faithful, so faithful
c2: |
 Oh Lord You are faithful, so faithful, so faithful
 Oh yes You are, You have saved my life from the grave
 And You made me whole
b1: |
 So I will sing to You, I will shout to You
 You are my rock, You are my rock
 I will worship you with all of my life
 You are my God, You are my God
