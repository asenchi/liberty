 Glory and honor and power to You our God
 Under Your mighty hand we are bowed down
 With joy fulfilling Your word, through the ages we'll sing
 Hosanna, praises to You
 You are the King

 Blessing and wisdom and might to You holy One
 We wear our robes washed white in the blood of the Lamb
 To You who sits on the throne, You created all things
 Reign now and forevermore; You are the King

 You are the King of kings, You are the Lord of lords
 You are the King of kings, You are the Lord
