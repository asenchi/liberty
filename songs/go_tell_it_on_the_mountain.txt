c1: |
 Go, tell it on the mountain
 Over the hills and everywhere
 Go, tell it on the mountain
 That Jesus Christ is born
v1: |
 While shepherds kept their watching
 Over silent flocks by night
 Behold throughout the heavens
 There shone a holy light
v2: |
 The shepherds feared and trembled
 When lo! above the earth
 Rang out the angels chorus
 That hailed the Savior's birth
v3: |
 Down in a lowly manger
 The humble Christ was born
 And God sent us salvation
 That blessed Christmas morn
