v1: |
 You come at the right time
 When I least expect it
 Never behind
 So why would I be surprised
 When You deliver
 Every time
pc1: |
 On mountaintops
 You stay the same
 In valleys low, You never change
c1: |
 And I believe that I will see
 The goodness of the Lord
 I'm confident as seasons change
 Your faithfulness remains
v2: |
 You go, You go before me
 To prepare the blessing
 You made a way
 It's more than I could imagine
 More than I can fathom
 Or comprehend
b1: |
 God of my present, God of my future
 You write the story
 You hold it all together
