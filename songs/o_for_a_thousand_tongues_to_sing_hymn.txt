 O for a thousand tongues to sing
 My great Redeemer's praise
 The glories of my God and King
 The triumphs of His grace

 My gracious Master and my God
 Assist me to proclaim
 To spread through all the earth abroad
 The honors of Thy name

 Jesus, the name that calms our fears
 That bids our sorrows cease
 'Tis music in the sinner's ears
 'Tis life and health and peace

 He breaks the power of cancelled sin
 He set the prisoners free
 His blood can make the foulest clean
 His blood availed for me

 He speaks and listening to His voice
 New life and dead receive
 The mournful broken hearts rejoice
 The humble poor believe

 Glory to God and praise and love
 Be ever, ever giv'n
 By saints below and saints above
 The church in earth and Heave'n
