v1: |
 Through waters uncharted my soul will embark
 I'll follow Your voice straight into the dark
 And if from the course You intend I depart
 Speak to the sails of my wandering heart
c1: |
 Like the wind
 You'll guide
 Clear the skies before me
 And I'll glide the open sea

 Like the stars
 Your Word
 Will align my voyage
 And remind me where I've been
 And where I am going
v2: |
 Lost in the shallows amidst fear and fog
 Your truth is the compass that points me back north
 Jesus my captain
 My soul's trusted Lord
 All my allegiance is rightfully Yours
