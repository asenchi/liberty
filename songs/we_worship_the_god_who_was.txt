v1: |
 We worship the God who was
 We worship the God who is
 We worship the God who evermore will be
 He opened the prison doors
 He parted the raging sea
 My God, He holds the victory
c1: |
 There's joy in the house of the Lord
 There's joy in the house of the Lord today
 And we won't be quiet
 We shout out Your praise
 There's joy in the house of the Lord
 Our God is surely in this place
 And we won't be quiet
 We shout out Your praise
v2: |
 We sing to the God who heals
 We sing to the God who saves
 We sing to the God who always makes a way
 He hung up on that cross
 Then He rose up from that grave
 My God's still rolling stones away
b1: |
 We were the beggars
 Now we're royalty
 We were the prisoners
 Now we're running free
 We are forgiven, accepted
 Redeemed by His grace
 Let the house of the Lord sing praise
