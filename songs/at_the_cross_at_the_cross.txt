v1: |
 At the cross, at the cross
 Where I first saw the light,
 And the burden of my heart rolled away
 It was there by faith I received my sight
 And now I am happy all the day
v2: |
 Was it for crimes that I have done He groaned upon the tree
 Amazing pity
 Grace unknown
 And love beyond degree
v3: |
 But drops of grief can ne’er repay the debt of love I owe
 Here, Lord I give myself away
 ‘Tis all that I can do
