 Lord I find You in the seeking
 Lord I find You in the doubt
 And to know You is to love You
 And to know so little else

 I need You
 Oh how I need You
 Oh how I need You
 Oh how I need You
v2: |
 Lord I find You in the morning
 Lord I seek You everyday
 Let my life be for Your glory
 Woven in Your threads of grace

 Light, glorious light
 I will go where You shine
 Break the dawn, crack the skies
 Make the way right before me
 In Your light I will find
 All I need, all I need is You
