v1: |
 O worship the King, all glorious above
 And gratefully sing, His power and His love
 Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days
 Pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise
v2: |
 Your bountiful care what tongue can recite
 It breathes in the air; it shines in the light
 It streams from the hills; it descends to the plain
 And sweetly distills; in the dew and the rain
v3: |
 O children of God though our strength be frail
 In You do we trust nor find You to fail
 Your mercies how tender, how firm to the end
 Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer and Friend
