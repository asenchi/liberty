v1: |
 Come thou Fount of every blessing
 Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing
 Call for songs of loudest praise
 Teach me some melodious sonnet
 Sung by flaming tongues above
 Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
 Mount of Thy redeeming love
v2: |
 Here I raise my Ebenezer
 Hither by Thy help I come
 And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
 Safely to arrive at home
 Jesus sought me when a stranger
 Wandering from the fold of God
 He, to rescue me from danger
 Interposed His precious blood
v3: |
 O to grace how great a debtor
 Daily I'm constrained to be
 Let Thy goodness like a fetter
 Bind my wandering heart to Thee
 Prone to wander, Lord I feel it
 Prone to leave the God I love
 Here's my heart, O take and seal it
 Seal it for Thy courts above
