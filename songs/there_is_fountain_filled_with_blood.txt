v1: |
 There is a fountain fileed with blood
 Drawn from Immanual's veins
 And sinners plunged beneath that flood
 Lose all their guilty stains
 Lose all their guilty stains
 Lose all their guilty stains
 And sinners plunged beneath that flood
 Lose all their guilty stains
v2: |
 The dying thief rejoiced to see
 That fountain in his day
 And there may I, though vile as he
 Wash all my sins away
 Wash all my sins away
 Wash all my sins away
 And there may I, though vile as he
 Wash all my sins away
v3: |
 Dear dying lamb, Thy precious blood
 Shall never lose it's pow'r
 Till all the ransomed church of God
 Be saved to sin no more
 Be saved to sin no more
 Be saved to sin no more
 Till all the ransomed church of God
 Be saved to sin no more
v4: |
 E'er since by faith I saw the stream
 Thy flowing wounds supply
 Redeeming love has been my theme
 And shall be till I die
 And shall be till I die
 And shall be till I die
 Redeeming love has been my theme
 And shall be till I die
v5: |
 When this poor lisping, stamm'ring tongue
 Lies silent in the grave
 Then in a nobler, sweeter song
 I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
 I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
 I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
 Then in a nobler, sweeter song
 I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
