v1: |
 I love You, Lord
 For Your mercy never fails me
 All my days, I've been held in Your hands
 From the moment that I wake up
 Until I lay my head
 Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
v2: |
 I love Your voice
 You have led me through the fire
 And in darkest night You are close like no other
 I've known You as a Father
 I've known You as a Friend
 And I have lived in the goodness of God
c1: |
 And all my life You have been faithful
 And all my life You have been so, so good
 With every breath that I am able
 Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
b1: |
 Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
 Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
 With my life laid down, Iâ€™m surrendered now
 I give you everything
 Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
