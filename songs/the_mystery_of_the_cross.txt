v1: |
 The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend
 The agonies of Calvary
 You the perfect holy One crushed Your Son
 Drank the bitter cup reserved for me
c1: |
 Your blood has washed away my sin
 Jesus thank You
 The Father's wrath completely satisfied
 Jesus thank You
 Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
 Jesus thank You
v2: |
 By Your perfect sacrifice I've been brought near
 Your enemy You've made Your friend
 Pouring out the riches of Your glorius grace
 Your mercy and Your kindness know no end
b1: |
 Lover of my soul I want to live for You
