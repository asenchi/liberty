v1: |
 When the ache of brokenness still lingers
 When the hour of loneliness is long
 I will stand upon Your sworn intention
 And I will praise Your promise with a song
c1: |
 And I will say goodness, I will say mercy,
 Surely Your love, oh God, has followed me
v2: |
 Even here, with sorrows all around me
 Still Your love is more than I have lost
 So, I will trust the hands that bled forgiveness
 And I will trust the heart that bore the cross
b1: |
 Only goodness and perfect joy you have in store
 All my fountains all my good is in you Lord
 Full assurance soon I'll see no more by faith
 That only goodness from the first was in your ways
