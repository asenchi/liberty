v1: |
 O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
 It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining
 Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
 A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
 For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
c1: |
 Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices
 O night divine, O night when Christ was born
 O night divine, O night, O night Divine
v2: |
 Truly He taught us to love one another
 His law is love and His gospel is peace
 Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother
 And in His name all oppression shall cease
 Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
 Let all within us praise His holy name
c2: |
 Christ is the Lord! O praise His name forever
 His pow’r and glory evermore proclaim
 His pow’r and glory evermore proclaim
