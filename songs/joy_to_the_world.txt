v1: |
 Joy to the world, the Lord has come
 Let earth receive her King
 Let every heart prepare Him room
 And Heaven and nature sing, and Heaven and nature sing
 And Heaven, and Heaven and nature sing
v2: |
 Joy to the world, the Savior reigns
 Let men their songs employ
 While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
 Repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy
 Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
v3: |
 No more let sins and sorrows grow
 Nor thorns infest the ground
 He comes to make His blessings flow
 Far as the curse is found, far as the curse is found
 Far as, far as the curse is found
v4: |
 He rules the world with truth and grace
 And makes the nations prove
 The glories of His righteousness
 And wonders of His love, and wonders of His love
 And wonders, wonders of His love
