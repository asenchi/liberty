c1: |
 I have a destiny I know I shall fulfill
 I have a destiny in that city on a hill
 I have a destiny and it's not an empty wish
 For I know I was born for such a time as this
v1: |
 Long before the ages You predestined me
 To walk in all the works You have prepared for me
 You've given me a part to play history
 To help prepare a bride for eternity
v2: |
 I did not choose You but You have chosen me
 And appointed me for bearing fruit abundantly
 I know You will complete the work begun in me
 By the power of Your spirit working mightily
