title: "The First Noel"
structure: [[v1,c1,v2,v3]]
v1: |
 The first noel, the angel did say
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
 In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep
c1: |
 Noel, noel, noel, noel
 Born is the King of Israel
v2: |
 They looked up and saw a star
 Shining in the east beyond them far
 And to the earth it gave great light
 And so it continued both day and night
v3: |
 Then let us all with one accord
 Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
 That hath made heaven and earth of naught
 And with His blood mankind hath bought
