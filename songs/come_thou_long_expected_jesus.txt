v1: |
 Come, thou long-expected Jesus
 Born to set Thy people free
 From our fears of sins release us
 Let us find our rest in Thee
 Israel's strength and consolation
 Hope of all the earth Thou art
 Dear desire of every nation
 Joy of every longing heart
v2: |
 Joy to those who long to see thee
 Dayspring from on high, appear
 Come, thou promised Rod of Jesse
 Of thy birth we long to hear
 Over the hills the angels singing news
 Glad tidings of a birth
 Go to him, your praises bringing
 Christ the Lord has come to earth
v3: |
 Come to earth to taste our sadness
 He whose glories knew no end
 By His life He brings us gladness
 Our Redeemer, Shepherd, Friend
 Leaving riches without number
 Born within a cattle stall
 This the everlasting wonder
 Christ was born the Lord of all
v4: |
 Born Thy people to deliver
 Born a child and yet a King
 Born to reign in us forever
 Now Thy gracious kingdom bring
 By Thine own eternal Spirit
 Rule in all our hearts alone
 By Thine own sufficient merit
 Raise us to Thy glorius throne
