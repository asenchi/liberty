v1: |
 I was a wretch, I remember who I was
 I was lost, I was blind, I was running out of time
 Sin separated, the breach was far to wide
 But from the far side of the chasm, You held me in your sight
v2: |
 So You made a way, across the great divide
 Left behind, Heavens throne, to build it here inside
 And there at the cross, You paid the debt I owed
 Broke my chains, freed my soul, for the first time I had hope
c1: |
 Thank you Jesus for the blood applied
 Thank you Jesus it has washed me white
 Thank you Jesus You have saved my life
 Brought me from the darkness into glorius light
v3: |
 You took my place, laid inside my tomb of sin
 You were buried for three days, and then you walked right out again
 And now death has no sting, and life no end
 For I have been transformed, by the blood of the lamb
b1: |
 There is nothing stronger than the wonder working power
 of the blood, the blood
 That calls us sons and daughters, we are ransomed by the Father
 Through the blood, the blood
