 I’ve been raised with Christ
 And I’ll keep seeking the things above
 O’ the things of my Lord
 I’ve been raised with Christ
 And I’ll not be satisfied with anything less
 Than all that God has for me
v2: |
 My soul will always seek You my Lord
 And my lips will always praise You with joy
 For my life has been given into Your hands

 Yes my soul will always seek You my Lord
 And my lips will always praise You with joy
 In my heart I have sanctified You as Lord
